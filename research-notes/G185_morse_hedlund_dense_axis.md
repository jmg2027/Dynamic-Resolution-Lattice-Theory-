# G185 — the Morse–Hedlund dense axis: aperiodic ⟹ no autonomous finite-state machine

**Tier 1 (volatile).**  The genuinely-heavy ∅-axiom target that remained after `G184` (where the
Garrabrant–Pak mod-2 axis turned out subsumed for its witnesses).  Now closed: the **dense**
non-holonomicity axis — sequences with *no long runs* (Thue–Morse, Sturmian) escaping every
autonomous finite-state machine, via the Morse–Hedlund argument.

## What was built (∅-axiom, `Cauchy/MorseHedlund.lean` 14 PURE + witness)

  - **Phase A — binary window encoding** (reusable): `binEnc k f = Σ_{t<k} b2n(f t)·2^t`,
    `binEnc_lt` (`< 2^k`), `binEnc_inj` (equal codes ⟹ equal windows).  Built from pure
    mod/div + binary bit recovery — no general binary-representation-uniqueness library.
  - **Phase B — `kStepDet_periodic`** (the Morse–Hedlund bounded direction): a `Bool`-sequence
    whose next value is determined by its length-`k` window (`kStepDet`) is **eventually
    periodic** — finitely many windows, deterministic shift, `ForwardPeriodicity.pigeonhole_collision`,
    forward propagation (`window_propagate`).
  - **Phase C — `aperiodic_not_autoRec`**: `AutoRec` over the `{0,1}`-embedding ⟹ `kStepDet` ⟹
    `EvPeriodic`; contrapositive (clean modus tollens, no `∃`-from-`¬∀`) — **any
    non-eventually-periodic `Bool`-sequence escapes every autonomous finite-state machine**,
    *including dense ones with no long runs*.  Now closed to an **iff**
    (`bool_autoRec_iff_evPeriodic`, 16 PURE): the converse `bool_evPeriodic_autoRec` builds the
    machine outright — period `p` + threshold `N` ⟹ window length `N+p`, single-slot rule
    `F w = w N` (since `a(n+N+p)=a(n+N)`).  Escaping `AutoRec` ⟺ aperiodic, no slack.
  - **Phase D — `isPow2_morse_not_autoRec`**: a concrete bounded aperiodic witness (the
    powers-of-two indicator is not eventually periodic — a gap-length-`p` window would force
    `false` forever — hence `¬ AutoRec`).  `ZeroRunNonHolonomicWitness` now 24 PURE.

## Why this is the dense companion

The sparse route (`zero_run_not_homogRec`, `χ`) needs *arbitrarily long zero-runs*; the
two-continuation route needs an explicit repeated window.  **Morse–Hedlund needs neither**: mere
aperiodicity (for a bounded sequence) already forces, for every memory `k`, two equal windows
with different continuations — so the autonomous-machine class is escaped *by any bounded
aperiodic sequence whatever*.  This is exactly the class the sparse route misses: dense,
bounded-run-length, aperiodic (Thue–Morse run-length ≤ 2, Sturmian complexity `n+1`).

## Phase E — Thue–Morse: the genuinely-dense witness (∅-axiom, `Cauchy/ThueMorseAperiodic.lean` 34 PURE)

The dense axis is now non-vacuous on the canonical example.  **Thue–Morse** (`tm`, run-length
`≤ 2`, no long runs) is defined by its self-similar recurrence via *fuel-structural* recursion
(well-founded recursion leaks `propext`), with a fuel-irrelevance lemma (`tmF_canon`, strong
induction on a fuel bound) pinning the canonical fuel `= n`.  The recurrence reads off as
`tm_even : tm(2n)=tm(n)`, `tm_odd : tm(2n+1)=¬tm(n)`, hence `tm_pair_differ : tm(2n+1)≠tm(2n)`
(never constant).  **Aperiodicity** (`tm_not_evPeriodic`) is the self-similar **period-descent**:

  - `even_descent` — a period `2q` halves to period `q` through `tm(2m)=tm(m)`;
  - `odd_descent` — a period `2r+1` drops to the even period `2r` (the auxiliary `tm(m+r)=¬tm(m)`
    via `tm_odd`+`tm_even`, applied twice cancels the negation);
  - strong induction on the period: even halves, odd drops-by-one to even, and period `1`
    contradicts `tm_pair_differ`.

`tm_morse_not_autoRec := aperiodic_not_autoRec tm tm_not_evPeriodic` — a concrete *dense*
inhabitant of the Morse–Hedlund escape, not the long-run `isPow2`.

### Run-length `≤ 2` — `tm_run_le_two`

The density is now a theorem, not a citation: `tm_run_le_two` proves Thue–Morse has **no three
consecutive equal values** (in any length-`3` window an adjacent differing pair already sits — at
an even start `(tm k, ¬tm k)`, at an odd start `(tm(k+1), ¬tm(k+1))`).  This is exactly what
makes Thue–Morse the *genuinely-dense* witness: the sparse `zero_run_not_homogRec` route needs
arbitrarily long constant runs, which `tm_run_le_two` forbids — so Thue–Morse escapes the
finite-state class **only** through the dense Morse–Hedlund route, not the sparse one.

**Location, sharply.**  `χ` escapes *both* machine classes (`chi_not_finiteRecurrence`) on the
back of its long zero-runs.  Thue–Morse escapes `AutoRec` only; whether it escapes `HomogRec`
(P-recursive) is **not** ∅-axiom-closable here, and not by accident — `tm_run_le_two` removes the
very zero-runs the cheap `HomogRec` certificate needs, so the only route to `¬ HomogRec` for a
no-long-run sequence is the deep *automatic ∧ aperiodic ⟹ non-holonomic* theorem
(Cobham/Christol), which has no constructive shadow.  Thue–Morse's P-recursive escape thus shares
π's open status: density is not a *strengthening* of the sparse witness but the regime where the
cheap certificate is structurally unavailable.

### The automatic structure — `tm_eq_popParity`

The companion fact: Thue–Morse *lacks* term-window memory (`AutoRec`) but *has* digit memory.
`tm_eq_popParity : tm n = decide (s2 n % 2 = 1)` proves `tm n` = parity of the binary digit-sum
`popcount(n)` — a two-state base-`2` automaton.  `s2` (fuel-structural `popcount`, `s2_even`,
`s2_odd`, `succ_parity` parity-flip).  This pins the exact divergence of the two finite-state
notions: finite memory *in the digits of the index* (automatic — Thue–Morse has it) vs *in the
previous terms* (window-recurrence — Thue–Morse lacks it).  Classically: automatic ∧ aperiodic
⟹ non-holonomic (Cobham/Christol); here both hypotheses are ∅-axiom, the term-window escape is
the elementary shadow.

### Realised as an actual continued fraction — `tmCF`

The dense axis is no longer abstract.  `tmCF n = b2n(tm n) + 1` is the `{1,2}`-valued Thue–Morse
partial-quotient sequence — a valid CF (`tmCF_ge_one : 1 ≤ aₙ`, `tmCF_mem : aₙ ∈ {1,2}`), bounded,
dense (`tm_run_le_two`), aperiodic (`tm_not_evPeriodic`), generated by no autonomous machine
(`tmCF_not_autoRec`).  The bridge is `autoRec_shift` (a constant shift `a ↦ a+c` preserves
`AutoRec`, compose the window-rule with the shift), so `tm_morse_not_autoRec` transports to the
shifted `{1,2}` sequence.  This is the marathon's subject — a continued fraction on the dense
non-holonomic axis — made concrete (autonomous escape; `HomogRec`/π-core stays open).

### The digit counter escapes the ring — `s2_not_eventually_monotone`

The companion at the *other* end: the digit counter `s2 = popcount` (unbounded, `s2_unbounded` via
`s2_ones : s2(ones k)=k`) returns to its minimum `1` at every power of two (`s2_pw2 : s2(2^k)=1`),
so it is **not eventually monotone** (`s2_not_eventually_monotone`; subtraction-free `ones`/`pw2`
families, `ones_ge`/`pw2_gt`).  A finite-Δ-depth integer sequence is eventually a polynomial, hence
eventually monotone — so `popcount` has no finite difference-depth: it sits *outside* the
`FiniteDepthAlgebra`/`NewtonGregory` generating ring while its bounded `{0,1}` readout `tm` is the
dense non-holonomic witness.  One structure, two ends: the readout escapes the *machine*, the
counter escapes the *ring*.

**Honest Lean status + the missing bridge.**  `s2_not_eventually_monotone` (213-native, ∅-axiom)
is the proven half.  Turning it into `¬ ∃ d, polyDepth d s2` needs exactly one bridge lemma:

> **`eventually_monotone_of_polyDepth` (open ∅-axiom target).**  `polyDepth d s → ∃ N, ∀ m n,
> N ≤ m → m ≤ n → s m ≤ s n` (a finite-Δ-depth integer sequence is eventually monotone).

Why it is not a quick reuse of `positive_floor_unbounded`: that lemma only fires when the top
difference is `≥ 1`, where it already builds `EvStrictMono` internally (via `evStrictMono_descend`)
— so the `c ≥ 1` branch of the bridge is *one call away*.  The obstruction is the **vanishing**
top-difference branch (`liftK (e+1) s 0 = 0`): over `ℕ`'s *truncated* `diff`, `liftK(e+1)s ≡ 0`
only gives `liftK e s` **non-increasing** (not `polyDepth e`), and indeed `popcount` is genuinely
polynomially bounded (`s2 n ≤ log₂ n ≤ n`), so growth alone yields no contradiction — the
oscillation is what kills it.  The faithful fix is the **`Int`** version: `polyDepthZ` +
`NewtonGregory.reconstruct` (exact Newton form, no truncation) + a both-sign `EvStrictMono` /
`EvStrictAnti` descent (the negative-`c` mirror of `positive_floor`).  Then `s2_not_eventually_
monotone` contraposes to `¬ ∃ d, polyDepthZ d (Int-embed s2)` cleanly.  Isolated, ∅-axiom-shaped,
~100 lines; flagged here rather than half-done.

## Honest scope

  - The earlier *formalized witness* (`isPow2`) happens also to have long runs (so the sparse
    route would catch it too); **Thue–Morse** (`ThueMorseAperiodic`, run-length `≤ 2`) closes the
    genuinely-dense gap — `aperiodic_not_autoRec` now has a dense inhabitant proven ∅-axiom.
    Sturmian (complexity `n+1`) remains the next dense instance, awaiting its own aperiodicity.
  - This closes the *autonomous* (time-invariant) machine class on the dense side.  It does
    **not** touch the time-varying P-recursive class (that is `HomogRec`/zero-runs) nor π (π's CF
    non-holonomicity remains classically open; even π's aperiodicity-as-a-CF is not the relevant
    statement — π's *partial quotients* are unbounded, a different object).

## The ∅-axiom non-holonomicity map, now

| machine class | escape criterion | witnesses |
|---|---|---|
| time-varying homogeneous P-recursive (`HomogRec`) | `zero_run_not_homogRec` (long zero-runs) | `(n!)ⁿ`, `χ`, Champernowne |
| time-invariant autonomous, *sparse* (`AutoRec`) | `two_continuations_not_autoRec` / `distinct_next_equal_window_not_autoRec` | `χ`, Champernowne |
| time-invariant autonomous, *dense* (`AutoRec`) | `aperiodic_not_autoRec` (Morse–Hedlund) | any bounded aperiodic — **Thue–Morse** (formalised, `tm_morse_not_autoRec`), `isPow2`; Sturmian next |

`χ` escapes the union `FiniteRecurrence = HomogRec ∨ AutoRec` (`chi_not_finiteRecurrence`).  The
three criteria together cover both machine classes across both densities — the full elementary
∅-axiom reach.  π stays the open core (no constructive shadow of the FGS analytic obstruction).

## The autonomous axis, closed to an iff

With `bool_autoRec_iff_evPeriodic` the `AutoRec` column is no longer a one-way escape: over the
`{0,1}`-embedding, `AutoRec ⟺ EvPeriodic` *exactly*.  So the entire content of "escapes the
autonomous machine" **is** "aperiodic" — the three escape criteria above are the only ways to
*exhibit* aperiodicity ∅-axiom (long zero-runs, a repeated window with two continuations, or the
Morse–Hedlund pigeonhole), but the class boundary itself is now a clean equivalence.  Dense
witnesses are not a stronger escape; they are the aperiodic sequences for which the first two
*cheap* exhibition routes are unavailable, leaving only Morse–Hedlund.

## Open conjecture — the elementary shadow of Cobham/Christol on the `HomogRec` side

The one genuinely-open ∅-axiom target this map leaves (short of π itself):

> **Conjecture (dense `HomogRec` escape).**  There is an *elementary, ∅-axiom* certificate `C`
> such that `C a ⟹ ¬ HomogRec a`, with `C` satisfiable by a **bounded, no-long-run** sequence
> (run-length `≤ B` for a fixed `B`).  Equivalently: an ∅-axiom witness that *some* digit-
> automatic aperiodic sequence (e.g. Thue–Morse, `tm_eq_popParity` + `tm_not_evPeriodic`) is not
> P-recursive — a constructive shadow of *automatic ∧ aperiodic ⟹ non-holonomic* that does **not**
> route through long zero-runs.

Why it is hard, sharply.  `HomogRec` is *time-varying*: the leading coefficient `lead(n)` may
change with `n`, so the Myhill–Nerode "one state, two outputs" obstruction (which kills `AutoRec`)
does **not** transfer — `two_continuations` is powerless here.  The only elementary handle is the
`zero_run` cascade (`lead(n)≠0` + a zero window ⟹ forced-zero tail), which `tm_run_le_two`
structurally denies.  So `C`, if it exists, must obstruct a *polynomial-coefficient* recurrence
without invoking a forced cascade from a constant window — a genuinely new mechanism.  Absent it,
Thue–Morse's `¬ HomogRec` sits at exactly π's status: true classically, no ∅-axiom shadow.

**Falsification handle.**  The conjecture is *false* if every bounded no-long-run aperiodic
sequence's non-P-recursivity provably requires a normality/Gauss–Kuzmin-strength input (the FGS
flavour) — i.e. if no finitary certificate can exist.  Either resolution is a real datum about
where the elementary/analytic boundary actually lies.
