# Slot tower ↔ main — cross-domain insights

Where this branch's slot-tower arc (`append→+→×→^`, the `^`-wall, the
`vp_separation` keystone, the fold criterion, the order-loss theorem) meets
what main brought in (LambertWeld, discrete Perelman/Ricci, `OrderMul`, the
"two pointings are one" essay).  Plain statements; pins to the Lean both
sides.  Open until a bridge theorem is written.

## 1. Equality is a certificate, and the certificate has a shape

Main's `when_two_pointings_are_one` (the weld essay): with no enclosing
line, "two pointings name the same real" is exactly as strong as the
combinatorial certificate that proves it — and the certificate has a *size*
(the per-level Padé flip, `48` at level one) and a *shape*
(presentation-shaped: the Lambert CF's linear partial-quotient growth).

This branch's `FoldCriterion.pow_eq_pow_iff_vp`: two powers are equal iff
their prime-exponent readings match at every prime.  That iff *is* a
certificate for "two numbers are equal" — and its content is the prime
structure (`vp`-vectors), licensed by `vp_separation` (the readings
determine the number).

**One shape, two domains**: equality is never free; it is a checkable
certificate, and the certificate's content is the structure of the object
(CF level for the weld real, prime exponents for the power).  Bridge to
write: state "equal ⟺ certificate matches" as one schema with the weld and
the power as two instances.

## 2. Order ⟺ no wrap (exact duals) — **CLOSED**, single schema written

Main's `Int213.OrderMul` (sign trichotomy): ℤ carries a translation-
invariant order — every nonzero integer is `> 0` or `< 0`.  This branch's
`NoOrderModP.no_wrapping_order`: the circle `1..p` carries *no* such order
(adding 1 walks back to the start, forcing `1 < 1`).

These are the **two sides of one fact**: a translation-invariant order
exists exactly when the structure does not wrap.  ℤ is the un-wrapped
counting line extended by sign and keeps the order; `mod p` folds the line
into a circle and loses it.  This is the price the `^`-wall's escape route
pays: you *can* fold into `mod p` to make every power solvable (discrete
logs always exist on a cyclic group), but the order the line had is gone.

**Bridge written** (`lean/E213/Meta/OrderWrap.lean`, 9 PURE).  A successor
structure `(M, s, a)` carries an `OrderWitness` (irreflexive + transitive +
`s`-equivariant + seed edge `a < s a`).  The single schema is the
obstruction:

* `no_order_of_wrap` — if the orbit `a, s a, s²a, …` returns to `a` after
  `n > 0` steps, **no** `OrderWitness` exists (walking the seed edge reaches
  `a < a`).

Two instances of the one schema:

* **ℤ** (`s = (·+1)`, `a = 0`): `intOrderWitness` exhibits the order, and
  `int_orbit_no_wrap` shows `orbit n = n ≠ 0` for `n > 0` — no wrap, so the
  schema produces no contradiction and the order survives.
* **ℤ/p** (`s = next p`, `a = 1`): `modp_no_order` — the orbit wraps
  (`orbit p = 1`), so the schema rules out every witness, re-deriving
  `no_wrapping_order` as a corollary.

So "order on `M` ⟺ `M` is wrap-free" is now one Lean object with ℤ (yes) and
`ℤ/p` (no) as the two readings.

## 3. The exp / log boundary: tame one way, wild the other

Main's LambertWeld: `exp(2/q)` and `coth(1/q)` of a rational are reachable
as tame cuts — the Lambert continued fraction has *linear* partial-quotient
growth, so the pointing is hypothesis-free (`weld_closed`, unconditional).

This branch's `^`-wall (`FoldCriterion.fold_iff_collinear`): `aˣ = b` for
incommensurable `a, b` (exponent-vectors not parallel) has no finite-tuple
answer — its solution (a logarithm) is the cut that does *not* fold back.

**Same boundary, two sides**: exponentiating a rational is *tame* (Lambert,
a clean cut), taking a logarithm across two different prime axes is *wild*
(the wall, a non-folding cut).  LambertWeld is the exp-half, FoldCriterion
the log-half, of the one exp/log story.  Bridge: place both on the
fold-back map — exp(ℚ) folds (tame CF), log of non-collinear primes does
not (the wall) — and ask what exactly separates the tame cuts from the wild
ones (CF growth rate vs exponent-vector independence; the weld essay's
"linear partial-quotient growth" is the tame marker).

## 4. The substrate's shape: metric facet vs topological facet

This branch's `Shape213` / `GridReadout213`: raising the substrate
dimension makes the readout vector-valued — but the honest internal readout
is the *shape* (an ordered factorization), and dimension = number of
factors; the metric dressings (area, perimeter) were the import to drop.

Main's discrete Perelman / Ricci core (`discrete_perelman_core.md`,
curvature stencils): the genuinely presentation-invariant version of "the
substrate has structure beyond a single count" is *topological* —
curvature, Euler characteristic, the Ricci flow programme.

**One knob, two readings**: "the substrate has shape" is read *metrically*
by the factorization/grid (this branch) and *topologically* by curvature
(main).  The curvature-as-Lens-readout essay (synthesis IV) already says
curvature is a difference-Lens count + sign; the bridge here is that the
factorization-shape and the curvature-shape are two readouts of the same
"a count is not enough once the substrate has more than one axis".

## 5. ↔ ORIGIN_RAW (genesis record): the tower is the synchronous foliation Lens

`seed/ORIGIN_RAW.md` rebuilds Raw from "difference" alone and, in §6–§8,
flags a **lockstep tension**: proceeding stage-by-stage ("now that stage 1
is over, let us all convert the lines into points!") bundles each layer into
one synchronized step, but the honest substrate is *asynchronous* — two
local event kinds, no global clock (Event 1 [differentiation: Line→Point],
Event 2 [contrast: Pair→Line]).

The slot tower is generated by `iter` (`add_eq_iter`, `mul_eq_iter`): each
rung is the previous operation repeated a **counted** number of times — which
presupposes exactly the global clock §6 distrusts.  So the whole `append→+→×→^`
tower is the **synchronous foliation-Lens reading** of Raw growth, and the
generating `ℕ` (count) *is* the clock.  Raw-floor content is the two events;
`+`·`×`·`^` are the clock iterating on itself (consistent with the branch's own
"`^` = where iteration becomes an *operation*").

Two sub-correspondences land cleanly:

- **The two events = the tower floor + the sync/async axis.**  append =
  sequential stitch (Event 2 contrast, order-kept, `append_not_comm_general`);
  count/`+` = Line→Point reify (Event 1, order-erased, `add_comm_from_append`);
  `×` = the grid all-pairs-at-once (§6 lockstep, order-erased by transpose,
  `mul_comm_from_grid`).  Shared invariant: **commutativity ⟺ simultaneity
  ⟺ order-forgetting** — the branch's atom-(in)distinguishability handle and
  ORIGIN_RAW's lockstep-vs-stitch handle are one handle.
- **The +/× turn = where Raw's primitive distinguishing re-surfaces.**  `+`
  forgets which unit (`append_comm`, units indistinguishable); `×` recovers
  it as prime axes (`vp_mul`, the exponent vector remembers which prime).  The
  tower locates the exact rung at which the genesis primitive (다름) returns to
  the readout.

### Open questions seeded here

(a) **Is there an asynchronous number tower?**  The slot tower is the
synchronous version (iter against the clock); ORIGIN_RAW's async two-event
system is closed in `theory/math/foundations/async_growth.md`.  Do `+`/`×`/`^`
have async analogues, or is "operation" *definitionally* clock-dependent —
i.e. **count-Lens = the clock**, with no async counterpart?  The latter would
be a sharp, testable claim.

Sharpened against the axiom corpus, three statements collapse to one point.
`seed/AXIOM/10_encoding_costs.md` §10.1 (row 1) charges the `ℕ`-induction
principle as the **order-of-construction cost** ("inductive types presuppose
ℕ; ℕ is a Lens result of Raw, so importing it priorly is a cost").
ORIGIN_RAW §6 names the same thing dynamically — the **lockstep clock**.  The
`^`-essay (`theory/essays/analysis/what_is_exponentiation.md`) locates `^` as
"where iteration becomes an *operation*".  Read together: **operation-ness
*is* the §10.1 cost** — to run an operation you must count (the clock), and
counting is `ℕ`-induction imported in advance.  So the number tower is the
**cost of `ℕ` unrolled into a ladder** — `count-Lens = the clock = §10.1
row 1`.  If this identification holds, (a) is answered negative: there is no
asynchronous number tower, because operation *is* synchrony.  The tower
keeps the same architectural status as the §4.3 uniqueness proofs (pure-`ℕ`,
Raw-not-imported, conducted *inside* a `ℕ`-Lens codomain — not before/outside
Raw).  Open: state the three-way identity as one Lean fact, or find the
async operation that refutes it.

(b) **`^`-wall ↔ ORIGIN_RAW §9 "level-2 ceiling": resonance or identity?**
Both are "regularity runs out at a rung": §9 (sequential natural-number strata
stop at level 2) and the `^`-wall (comm/assoc die at `^`, the log does not fold
back — `two_three_unique`, `fold_iff_collinear`).  The resonance is plain;
asserting the *same* ceiling would be stereotype-matching.  Whether the two
ceilings coincide is open.

---

Bridge 2 is **CLOSED** (single schema `OrderWrap.no_order_of_wrap` + two
instances, 9 PURE).  Bridges 1, 3, 4 remain **open** main↔branch
correspondences; §5 adds the ORIGIN_RAW relation and questions (a)/(b).  For
the open ones the claim is plain but the single-schema Lean statement is not
yet written.  Recorded so the correspondence is tracked, not lost to chat.
