# Slot-tower debate — two-round panel verdicts (the handle, the genesis)

Two-round multi-agent debate over the slot-tower arc
(`UnitList/UnitGrid/TwoThreeUnique/VpMul/BinTree213/HyperAssoc/Iterate213/
CoAppend213/Convolution213` + the originator's Raw-genesis probe).
Round 1: adversary / unifier / number theorist / foundations skeptic
(parallel).  Round 2: judge (the handle collision) + 213-native defender
(the genesis).  Every load-bearing claim below was source-verified by at
least one panelist.  This note records the **surviving verdicts** and the
**merged brick agenda**; it is the debate's record, not a chapter.

## ★ Post-debate UPDATE — the keystone (DEBT) is CLOSED

`vp_separation` — `(∀ p prime, vp p m = vp p n) → m = n`, the unique-
factorization faithfulness the whole triage called the DEBT — is now a
PURE theorem (`lean/E213/Meta/Nat/VpSeparation.lean`, 8 PURE: a local
`exists_prime_factor` least-divisor search + the strong-induction descent
`vp_div_prime`/`vp_div_prime_other`).  Consequences the debate predicted,
now unblocked / discharged:

- **The DEBT axis is paid.**  `exp(n) = (vp 2 n, …)` is now a *faithful*
  coordinate (a monoid iso `(ℕ₊,×) ≅ ⊕_p ℕ`), not a promissory note.
- **The fold criterion's ⟸ direction** (sufficiency, "IS `vp_separation`")
  is now provable — fold ⟺ collinearity can be stated as a full iff.
- **The fusion bridge** (wall = role-asymmetry + prime-independence as two
  named hypotheses over a faithful `exp`) drops from NEEDS(`vp_separation`)
  to PROVABLE-NOW.
- **The `log_q p` irrational family** (general, all prime pairs) is now
  provable, not gated.
- The **two-fact split stands** (it never depended on UFD being open):
  `pow_not_comm` and `two_three_unique` still share no lemma; UFD fuses
  them as two hypotheses of one theorem, exactly as the judge said.

Brick-agenda item 1 below is therefore DONE; items 2/3/5 are unblocked.

## Verdict A — thesis / mechanism / debt (the handle triage)

Three round-1 positions collided ("one handle = atom (in)distinguishability"
vs "the true unification is the count-rig (ℕ,+,×)" vs "everything is
promissory on `vp_separation`").  Judge's adjudication — they are
**consistent as a triage**:

| role | candidate | status |
|---|---|---|
| **THESIS** | atom-(in)distinguishability | aim; half proved (commutativity side), half instance-only (wall side) |
| **MECHANISM** | the count-rig `(ℕ,+,×)` via `iter_add`/`iter_mul` | proved; generates the tower and the surviving laws; covers the role-asymmetry ingredient, does **not** reach prime-independence |
| **DEBT** | `vp_separation` (UFD faithfulness) | OPEN; the only item converting the thesis from slogan to theorem |

**The adversary's split is real and survives**: at the proof level the
^-wall is **two independent facts** — base/exponent role-asymmetry
(`pow_not_comm`, prime-free, a closed-numeral `decide`) and
prime-independence (`two_three_unique`, parity/Euclid route) — sharing no
lemma.  Even a proved UFD fuses them only as **two named hypotheses of one
theorem** (the `exp`-iso bridge), not into one fact.  Every "one primitive
at two rungs" sentence is a promissory note against `vp_separation` until
that closes.

**Rank correction** (judge, fixing the adversary's ℕ² counterexample): the
wall is **visible at every rank ≥ 2** (ℕ² *is* the rank-2 exponent lattice;
`(1,0) ∦ (0,1)`); only **rank 1** (mod p, cyclic) kills it.  Rank — not
flatness rhetoric — is the load-bearing parameter.

**Fold criterion, honest form** (number theorist + adversary): scope to
**ℚ-exponents and `a, b ≥ 2`** (ℕ-folding fails at `4^x = 8`; `a=1`/`b=1`/
`a=0` undefine collinearity).  Direction split: **(⟹) necessity is
PROVABLE-NOW** — `a^r = b^q → r·vp p a = q·vp p b`, a 5-line `vp_pow`
corollary, cross-multiplied (log-free, ℚ-object-free); **(⟸) sufficiency
IS `vp_separation`** in disguise.  The wall's asymmetry = exactly this
easy/hard split.

**Found money** (judge, correcting the number theorist): the supposed
missing brick `exists_prime_factor` **already exists PURE** at
`Lib/Math/NumberTheory/FourSquare.lean:543`, producing definitionally the
`IsPrime213` shape.  `vp_separation`'s remaining work is the mechanical
strong-induction descent (`vp_div_prime` is a one-line `vp_mul` corollary).

**Unasked-for consequence** (number theorist): `vp_pow` already contains
**irrationality of `log_q p` for every distinct prime pair** — `q^a = p^b`
forces `a=b=0` by the same vp-collision; `two_three_unique` was one
instance of a family.  The wall is ∞-fold, not the `{2,3}` corner.

## Verdict B — the genesis (Raw → ℕ): the panel's genesis story was RETRACTED

**Originator correction (post-debate).**  Round 2's "genesis" verdicts were
built on two agent errors and one misquotation, and are withdrawn:

- **The "genesis primitive is binary `slash`, Raw bifurcates, the *first*
  distinguishing is a pair coming apart" centerpiece is WRONG — it reads the
  Lean *encoding* as Raw's ontology, the exact failure §6.1/§6.2 name.**
  §6.1: "The Lean encoding `inductive Tree | a | b | slash` therefore
  hardcodes one chart."  §6.2: "The `inductive Tree` shape forces a
  node/arrow separation that the axiom does not impose.  This separation
  lives in the labelling, **not in Raw**."  So `slash`'s binary
  anti-reflexive shape is a writing artifact of the inductive type, not a
  claim that Raw "splits."  **Raw does not bifurcate.**
- **There is no "first" distinguishing in Raw.**  §5.5: pointing is already
  complete, the §2.4 clause numbering is "a notational decomposition for
  readability," no ordering is available.  §6.5: "'Raw has two atoms a, b'
  is *already* a count-Lens reading; at pre-Lens level point and K_∞ are
  indistinguishable" — even a "first colour" is a Lens reading, not a Raw
  event.  The defender's reified "first distinguishing" imported a sequence
  Raw does not have.
- **The "pick ONE, append ONE → cardinal-1 petitio" critique attacked a
  paraphrase the originator never wrote.**  The actual words contain no
  cardinal "one": *"원시 구별된 것들만 있는 곳에서는 어차피 방법이
  하나밖에 없어 …숫자도 없으니 여러개의 뭉탱이로 나눠서 줏어담을 수도 없고.
  pointing이라는 건 append로도 표현이 되는구나."*  The only "하나" is
  *"방법이 하나"* — the **measuring method is unique**, not "grab one item."

**The originator's actual claim, stated correctly (count-Lens level, no Raw
mis-projection).**  This is a claim about **measuring / gathering** (a Lens
act), not about how Raw is built.  In a place carrying only mutual
distinction and **no numbers**, the method of gathering the distinguished
into a measurable form is **unique** — because (i) gathering always leaves
residue and re-gathering leaves residue again (inexhaustibility,
`object1_not_surjective`), and (ii) with no numbers you cannot parametrise
the gathering by a bundle-count (no k-at-a-time).  Method-uniqueness, from
inexhaustibility + numberlessness — *not* from "increment by one."  Hence
**pointing is expressible as `append`**: append is the one available
gathering-Lens, and ℕ is its count-readout.  No "first," no "one," no
"bifurcation" enters.  (The `fromNat`/`count` separation and the
per-pointing-completion-vs-residue-inexhaustibility distinction the panel
found are the genuine technical points and survive; everything framed as a
Raw-level genesis operation is withdrawn.)

## Merged brick agenda (ranked; provenance = which panelist)

1. **`vp_separation`** — the keystone.  ★ **CLOSED**
   (`Meta/Nat/VpSeparation.lean`, 8 PURE): own `exists_prime_factor`
   least-divisor search (a local clone, not an up-import from
   `FourSquare`, to keep `Meta` below `Lib`) + the strong-induction
   descent.  [NT, ADV, UNI all demanded — now delivered]
2. **The fold criterion (full iff)** — ★ **CLOSED**
   (`Meta/Nat/FoldCriterion.lean`): `pow_eq_pow_iff_vp` (both directions —
   ⟹ on `vp_pow`, ⟸ on `vp_separation`), `fold_iff_collinear`, and
   `prime_pow_unique` (`p^a=q^b→a=b=0`, distinct primes) with
   `two_three_unique` recovered as the `2,3` instance.  [NT]
3. **`wall_is_atom_independence` (fusion bridge)** — one theorem naming
   both wall ingredients over `exp`; now PROVABLE-NOW in general (the
   general form's `vp_separation` gate is closed).  `prime_pow_unique`
   already delivers the prime-independence half.  [ADV, UNI]
4. **`no_wrapping_order`** — ★ **CLOSED** (`Meta/Nat/NoOrderModP.lean`):
   no irreflexive, `next`-preserving order with `1<2` survives folding the
   counting line into the circle `1..p` — order is the price of wrapping,
   now a theorem.  [NT — was the cheapest item]
5. **`comm_from_transpose`** — the one-statement commutativity theorem
   (swap + role-forgetting readout) covering append/grid/conv.
   PROVABLE-NOW (2-line core; per-instance content = the `hR`
   transpose-invariance, e.g. `heads_tails_total`).  [UNI]
6. **`mem_splits_append` (bialgebra compatibility)** — cuts of a
   concatenation = cuts falling in `l` or in `m`; "distributivity = the
   two Lenses commute" IS the bialgebra axiom.  PROVABLE-NOW on
   `mem_splits_iff` + `append_cancel`.  Antipode/Hopf NEEDS(ℤ-readout
   wiring).  [UNI]
7. **`conv_assoc` via `natSplits` coassociativity** — triple-cut reindex +
   `sumMap`; upgrades (glue, split, conv) to a verified convolution
   algebra.  PROVABLE-NOW but real (~half day).  [UNI]
8. **Tetration ghost** — `iter (a^·) (m·n) 1 = iter (iter (a^·) n) m 1` is
   a free `iter_mul` instance (PROVABLE-NOW); the companion **no-go**
   (`iter_mul_block` has no analog past `^` — the ghost is "real but
   unreadable") NEEDS a small irreducibility argument.  [UNI]
9. **`tower_iff_not_idem`** — tower of height ≥2 ⟺ rung-operator
   non-idempotent at the base; classifies which operators climb at all.
   PROVABLE-NOW.  [UNI]
10. **Hilbert parity instance** — "−1 is a non-square at exactly ∞ and
    p≡3(4): an even set" — ASSEMBLY of `int_sumSq_eq_zero` +
    `no_sqrt_neg_one_4k3` (both already proved).  [NT]
11. **`log_q p` irrational family** — per-pair PROVABLE-NOW (general form
    gated on `vp_separation`).  [NT]
12. **`discrete_log_exists`** — primitive-root orbit fills the units
    (one pigeonhole bridge; `segInt_pairwise` nearly does it).  [NT]

## Co-signed central claim (judge's final paragraph, compressed)

The climb `append→+→×→^` is one combinator (iteration) whose count slot is
additive-then-multiplicative (PROVED: `iter_add`/`iter_mul`; the
fold-one-rung-down = `iter_mul` surfacing as `pow_surviving`).  The climb
keeps comm+assoc through `×` and loses both at `^` (PROVED).
+-commutativity from unit-indistinguishability is PROVED; the wall as
×-atom distinguishability is PROVED **only in the rank-2 instance**
(`two_three_unique`), and at proof level the wall is **two independent
facts** (role-asymmetry + prime-independence) whose fusion over a faithful
`exp` awaits `vp_separation` (OPEN).  Thesis: atom-(in)distinguishability.
Mechanism: the count-rig.  Debt: `vp_separation`.

## Round 3 (later session) — the async-tower question (§5(a))

Three-agent panel (affirmative / adversary / formalist) on
`slot_tower_crossdomain.md` §5(a): "is there an asynchronous number tower,
or is operation-ness definitionally clock-dependent (count-Lens = the
clock)?"

- **Affirmative** (synchrony thesis): every tower rung factors through
  `iter : (α→α) → Nat → α → α` against the one count-slot
  (`add_eq_iter`/`mul_eq_iter`/`pow_eq_iter`); `fire` has no count slot.
  Strongest self-identified weak point: the link from `iter_mul` (order of
  operations) to *synchrony* (a dynamic property) is not itself a theorem.
- **Adversary** (async-operation seeker): the thesis HOLDS for the tower but
  the *universal* "operation = forward-counting" is refuted by
  `Convolution213.conv` — a genuine commutative operation defined by
  `natSplits` (all `(i,j)`, `i+j=n`), a decomposition *constraint*, not a
  forward count.  "uses `Nat`" ≠ "forward-counts".
- **Formalist** (Lean spine): the three `*_eq_iter` theorems are the spine;
  their conjunction is **vacuous**.  No hyperoperation ladder existed in the
  repo.  A non-vacuous unifier *does* exist and is buildable ∅-axiom — the
  single recursion `hyperop (k+1) a b = iter (hyperop k a) b (seed k a)` —
  **provided** flavour-matching avoids `funext` (which pulls `Quot.sound`)
  by a pointwise `iter_congr`.

**Judge synthesis (acted on).**  The adversary's `conv` is not async: its
all-pairs-at-once is §6's *simultaneous* lockstep, a second **clocked**
foliation, not a clock-free one.  So there are two clocked readings —
sequential (`iter`, the tower) and simultaneous (grid/convolution) —
matching ORIGIN_RAW's two events; only `fire` is clock-free (an *event*, not
an operation).  Refined verdict: **every number operation is clocked; only
events are clock-free** — "operation-ness is synchrony" survives once
"synchrony" = *clocked* (either foliation), not *forward-counting alone*.

**Deliverable**: `lean/E213/Meta/Nat/HyperLadder.lean` (8 PURE) — the tower
as one recursion turning the count-clock (`hyperop 1/2/3 = +`/`×`/`^`),
funext-free via `iter_congr`.  The philosophical three-way identity
(`Nat`-clock = §10.1 ℕ-induction cost = lockstep clock) is left as narrative
gloss — stating it as a Lean equation would be the vacuous move.

---

## Round 4 (later session) — the level-2 ceiling vs ^-wall (§5(b))

Two-agent panel (identity proponent / skeptic) on `slot_tower_crossdomain.md`
§5(b): is the ORIGIN_RAW §9 "level-2 ceiling" the SAME fact as the `^`-wall,
or a resonance?

- **Proponent** (identity): best line — "the order-2 swap symmetry is
  adequate through level 2, insufficient at level 3" (`level3_diverges` is
  literally "beyond swap"; `pow_not_comm` is argument-swap failure).  Honest
  self-verdict: **defensible but NOT formalizable** — the only Lean statements
  are the vacuous conjunction; recommended following §5(a)'s precedent (leave
  as gloss).
- **Skeptic** (resonance, the CLAUDE.md default): four-attack refutation —
  the two boundaries are pinned by **different objects** (tree depth vs
  operation arity), **different swaps** (`Raw.swap` involution on the Raw type
  vs argument-commutativity of a `Nat→Nat→Nat` function), **different
  predicates** (past-completeness / subterm closure vs comm/assoc), and
  **different mechanisms** (slash-DAG reachability vs exponent-becomes-an-
  operation).  The shared "2/3" is two incommensurable countings.

**Both converged: RESONANCE, NOT IDENTITY.**  No Lean deliverable — the only
formalizable statement is `level3_diverges ∧ pow_not_comm` (vacuous: "both
hold", not "same phenomenon").  Forcing a bridge ("past-completeness failure
⟺ commutativity loss") would be the named stereotype-matching failure mode.
What is honestly shared is a *phenomenological shape* (a downward-closed
regularity zone breaking at the third rung), not a mechanism.  §5(b) closed as
resonance; correctly produces no file.

---

## Round 5 (later session) — bridge 1's `LeveledReadout`: REJECTED as vacuous

Attempt + skeptic audit on bridge 1 ("equal ⟺ certificate matches" as one
schema).  A `LeveledReadout` structure was written (`eq`, `readout : X→Idx→Val`,
`sound`, `faithful`) with `eq_iff_readout : eq x y ↔ ∀ i, readout x i =
readout y i`, instantiated by the real `cutEq` (definitional faithfulness) and
the integer `vp_separation` (theorem faithfulness).  It built **3 PURE** and
both instances were genuine.

**Skeptic verdict: VACUOUS-OR-FORCIBLE — not committed; file deleted.**
- `eq_iff_readout` is a one-line tautological unpacking of the `sound`/
  `faithful` fields — it does zero work.
- No generic consumer: nothing proves anything over *all* faithful readouts,
  so the structure is a container, not a tool (contrast bridge 2's
  `no_order_of_wrap`, which rules witnesses out).
- The two instances are *stapled* — fitting a definition (`cutEq`) and a deep
  theorem (`vp_separation`) under one record does not explain *why* one is
  definitional and the other earned; that "why" is narrative.
- Exposing `readout` as a function is cosmetic over the forbidden
  `{ cert : Prop, iff : eq ↔ cert }` the frontier explicitly warns against.

**Kept**: the narrative insight — equality-as-readout-agreement is
*definitional* for cuts, an *earned theorem* (UFD) for integers.  **Lesson**:
do not re-write the `{cert, iff}`/`LeveledReadout` structure; a non-vacuous
bridge 1 needs a theorem doing generic work over faithful readouts.  The
debate method worked as intended — it caught a forcible unification before it
was committed.
