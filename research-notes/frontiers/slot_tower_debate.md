# Slot-tower debate — two-round panel verdicts (the handle, the genesis)

Two-round multi-agent debate over the slot-tower arc
(`UnitList/UnitGrid/TwoThreeUnique/VpMul/BinTree213/HyperAssoc/Iterate213/
CoAppend213/Convolution213` + the originator's Raw-genesis probe).
Round 1: adversary / unifier / number theorist / foundations skeptic
(parallel).  Round 2: judge (the handle collision) + 213-native defender
(the genesis).  Every load-bearing claim below was source-verified by at
least one panelist.  This note records the **surviving verdicts** and the
**merged brick agenda**; it is the debate's record, not a chapter.

## Verdict A — thesis / mechanism / debt (the handle triage)

Three round-1 positions collided ("one handle = atom (in)distinguishability"
vs "the true unification is the count-rig (ℕ,+,×)" vs "everything is
promissory on `vp_separation`").  Judge's adjudication — they are
**consistent as a triage**:

| role | candidate | status |
|---|---|---|
| **THESIS** | atom-(in)distinguishability | aim; half proved (commutativity side), half instance-only (wall side) |
| **MECHANISM** | the count-rig `(ℕ,+,×)` via `iter_add`/`iter_mul` | proved; generates the tower and the surviving laws; covers the role-asymmetry ingredient, does **not** reach prime-independence |
| **DEBT** | `vp_separation` (UFD faithfulness) | OPEN; the only item converting the thesis from slogan to theorem |

**The adversary's split is real and survives**: at the proof level the
^-wall is **two independent facts** — base/exponent role-asymmetry
(`pow_not_comm`, prime-free, a closed-numeral `decide`) and
prime-independence (`two_three_unique`, parity/Euclid route) — sharing no
lemma.  Even a proved UFD fuses them only as **two named hypotheses of one
theorem** (the `exp`-iso bridge), not into one fact.  Every "one primitive
at two rungs" sentence is a promissory note against `vp_separation` until
that closes.

**Rank correction** (judge, fixing the adversary's ℕ² counterexample): the
wall is **visible at every rank ≥ 2** (ℕ² *is* the rank-2 exponent lattice;
`(1,0) ∦ (0,1)`); only **rank 1** (mod p, cyclic) kills it.  Rank — not
flatness rhetoric — is the load-bearing parameter.

**Fold criterion, honest form** (number theorist + adversary): scope to
**ℚ-exponents and `a, b ≥ 2`** (ℕ-folding fails at `4^x = 8`; `a=1`/`b=1`/
`a=0` undefine collinearity).  Direction split: **(⟹) necessity is
PROVABLE-NOW** — `a^r = b^q → r·vp p a = q·vp p b`, a 5-line `vp_pow`
corollary, cross-multiplied (log-free, ℚ-object-free); **(⟸) sufficiency
IS `vp_separation`** in disguise.  The wall's asymmetry = exactly this
easy/hard split.

**Found money** (judge, correcting the number theorist): the supposed
missing brick `exists_prime_factor` **already exists PURE** at
`Lib/Math/NumberTheory/FourSquare.lean:543`, producing definitionally the
`IsPrime213` shape.  `vp_separation`'s remaining work is the mechanical
strong-induction descent (`vp_div_prime` is a one-line `vp_mul` corollary).

**Unasked-for consequence** (number theorist): `vp_pow` already contains
**irrationality of `log_q p` for every distinct prime pair** — `q^a = p^b`
forces `a=b=0` by the same vp-collision; `two_three_unique` was one
instance of a family.  The wall is ∞-fold, not the `{2,3}` corner.

## Verdict B — the genesis (Raw → ℕ): the panel's genesis story was RETRACTED

**Originator correction (post-debate).**  Round 2's "genesis" verdicts were
built on two agent errors and one misquotation, and are withdrawn:

- **The "genesis primitive is binary `slash`, Raw bifurcates, the *first*
  distinguishing is a pair coming apart" centerpiece is WRONG — it reads the
  Lean *encoding* as Raw's ontology, the exact failure §6.1/§6.2 name.**
  §6.1: "The Lean encoding `inductive Tree | a | b | slash` therefore
  hardcodes one chart."  §6.2: "The `inductive Tree` shape forces a
  node/arrow separation that the axiom does not impose.  This separation
  lives in the labelling, **not in Raw**."  So `slash`'s binary
  anti-reflexive shape is a writing artifact of the inductive type, not a
  claim that Raw "splits."  **Raw does not bifurcate.**
- **There is no "first" distinguishing in Raw.**  §5.5: pointing is already
  complete, the §2.4 clause numbering is "a notational decomposition for
  readability," no ordering is available.  §6.5: "'Raw has two atoms a, b'
  is *already* a count-Lens reading; at pre-Lens level point and K_∞ are
  indistinguishable" — even a "first colour" is a Lens reading, not a Raw
  event.  The defender's reified "first distinguishing" imported a sequence
  Raw does not have.
- **The "pick ONE, append ONE → cardinal-1 petitio" critique attacked a
  paraphrase the originator never wrote.**  The actual words contain no
  cardinal "one": *"원시 구별된 것들만 있는 곳에서는 어차피 방법이
  하나밖에 없어 …숫자도 없으니 여러개의 뭉탱이로 나눠서 줏어담을 수도 없고.
  pointing이라는 건 append로도 표현이 되는구나."*  The only "하나" is
  *"방법이 하나"* — the **measuring method is unique**, not "grab one item."

**The originator's actual claim, stated correctly (count-Lens level, no Raw
mis-projection).**  This is a claim about **measuring / gathering** (a Lens
act), not about how Raw is built.  In a place carrying only mutual
distinction and **no numbers**, the method of gathering the distinguished
into a measurable form is **unique** — because (i) gathering always leaves
residue and re-gathering leaves residue again (inexhaustibility,
`object1_not_surjective`), and (ii) with no numbers you cannot parametrise
the gathering by a bundle-count (no k-at-a-time).  Method-uniqueness, from
inexhaustibility + numberlessness — *not* from "increment by one."  Hence
**pointing is expressible as `append`**: append is the one available
gathering-Lens, and ℕ is its count-readout.  No "first," no "one," no
"bifurcation" enters.  (The `fromNat`/`count` separation and the
per-pointing-completion-vs-residue-inexhaustibility distinction the panel
found are the genuine technical points and survive; everything framed as a
Raw-level genesis operation is withdrawn.)

## Merged brick agenda (ranked; provenance = which panelist)

1. **`vp_separation`** — the keystone.  Prereq `exists_prime_factor`
   already PURE (`FourSquare.lean:543`); remaining = strong-induction
   descent via `vp_div_prime` (= one-line `vp_mul` corollary).  [NT, ADV,
   UNI all demanded]
2. **Fold ⟹ direction** — `a^r = b^q → ∀p prime, r·vp p a = q·vp p b`.
   PROVABLE-NOW, 5 lines on `vp_pow`.  [NT]
3. **`wall_is_atom_independence` (rank-2 fusion bridge)** — one theorem
   naming both wall ingredients over `exp`; rank-2 form PROVABLE-NOW,
   general form NEEDS(`vp_separation`).  [ADV, UNI]
4. **`no_compatible_order_mod_p`** — no translation-invariant strict order
   survives wrapping (`0<1<…<0` cycle).  PROVABLE-NOW ~15 lines; makes
   "order is the price of curvature" a theorem.  [NT — cheapest item]
5. **`comm_from_transpose`** — the one-statement commutativity theorem
   (swap + role-forgetting readout) covering append/grid/conv.
   PROVABLE-NOW (2-line core; per-instance content = the `hR`
   transpose-invariance, e.g. `heads_tails_total`).  [UNI]
6. **`mem_splits_append` (bialgebra compatibility)** — cuts of a
   concatenation = cuts falling in `l` or in `m`; "distributivity = the
   two Lenses commute" IS the bialgebra axiom.  PROVABLE-NOW on
   `mem_splits_iff` + `append_cancel`.  Antipode/Hopf NEEDS(ℤ-readout
   wiring).  [UNI]
7. **`conv_assoc` via `natSplits` coassociativity** — triple-cut reindex +
   `sumMap`; upgrades (glue, split, conv) to a verified convolution
   algebra.  PROVABLE-NOW but real (~half day).  [UNI]
8. **Tetration ghost** — `iter (a^·) (m·n) 1 = iter (iter (a^·) n) m 1` is
   a free `iter_mul` instance (PROVABLE-NOW); the companion **no-go**
   (`iter_mul_block` has no analog past `^` — the ghost is "real but
   unreadable") NEEDS a small irreducibility argument.  [UNI]
9. **`tower_iff_not_idem`** — tower of height ≥2 ⟺ rung-operator
   non-idempotent at the base; classifies which operators climb at all.
   PROVABLE-NOW.  [UNI]
10. **Hilbert parity instance** — "−1 is a non-square at exactly ∞ and
    p≡3(4): an even set" — ASSEMBLY of `int_sumSq_eq_zero` +
    `no_sqrt_neg_one_4k3` (both already proved).  [NT]
11. **`log_q p` irrational family** — per-pair PROVABLE-NOW (general form
    gated on `vp_separation`).  [NT]
12. **`discrete_log_exists`** — primitive-root orbit fills the units
    (one pigeonhole bridge; `segInt_pairwise` nearly does it).  [NT]

## Co-signed central claim (judge's final paragraph, compressed)

The climb `append→+→×→^` is one combinator (iteration) whose count slot is
additive-then-multiplicative (PROVED: `iter_add`/`iter_mul`; the
fold-one-rung-down = `iter_mul` surfacing as `pow_surviving`).  The climb
keeps comm+assoc through `×` and loses both at `^` (PROVED).
+-commutativity from unit-indistinguishability is PROVED; the wall as
×-atom distinguishability is PROVED **only in the rank-2 instance**
(`two_three_unique`), and at proof level the wall is **two independent
facts** (role-asymmetry + prime-independence) whose fusion over a faithful
`exp` awaits `vp_separation` (OPEN).  Thesis: atom-(in)distinguishability.
Mechanism: the count-rig.  Debt: `vp_separation`.
