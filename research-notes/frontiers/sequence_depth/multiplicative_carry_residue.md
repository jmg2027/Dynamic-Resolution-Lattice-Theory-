# Frontier — the multiplicative carry as a νF inhabitant (the residue of ×)

Status: **core CLOSED** (`lean/E213/Lib/Math/NumberSystems/Padic/NuEscape.lean`); only the
Lens-reading refinement (item 3) remains soft-open.

## The frontier question — answered YES

*Is the multiplicative carry itself a νF inhabitant?*  **Yes.**  `gspine` is generic over the leaf
alphabet (CoResidue §20), so the carry stream `mulCarry : Nat → Nat` is `gspine (mulCarry …) :
GCoShape Nat` — a consistent, anti-reflexive co-tree reached by no finite Raw (`carry_is_nu_escape`,
`gspine_escapes` at `L = Nat`).  And it is a *genuine* (unbounded) escape:

- `neg_one_sq_eq_one` — `(-1)² = 1`: the **result** is the trivial µF element `1`.
- `mulCarry_unbounded` — the carry is unbounded, the exact dual of `add_carry_le_one` (carry `≤ 1`).
- `mul_carry_nu_residue` — capstone: result `= 1`, carry is a νF escape, carry unbounded.

So **finite-state-ness is a property of the pointing (the carry), not the number (the result `1`)**:
the same real `1` is reached, while the multiplication-carry escapes the finite the way `spineL`
does — the ring-operation image of `Real213/PresentationDependence` ("holonomicity is a property of
the pointing, not the real").  The supporting helper `AddMod213.div_le_div_right_pure` (pure
monotone div) was added to `Meta/Nat`.

## What is closed

The carrier-arithmetic split between `+` and `×` is now precise, ∅-axiom:

- `+` is **finite-state**: `add_carry_le_one` — `Zp.add`'s carry is always a single bit (the
  odometer unit, `Theory/Raw/Odometer`).
- `×` is **native corecursive but not finite-state**:
  - corecursive — `mul_corecursive` (head `residue_mul` `(x·y)₀=x₀·y₀`, tail `mulRaw_tail`
    `(x·y)'=x₀·y'+x'·y`, emit/advance `mul_digit_carry_step`): `Zp.mul` is a coalgebra morphism for
    the carrier shift (CoResidue §21), the Cauchy product's behavioural differential equation;
  - not finite-state — `mulRaw_negOne_negOne` (`mulRaw (-1)(-1) k = (k+1)(p-1)²`) + `mulRaw_unbounded`,
    the exact dual of `add_carry_le_one`.

So the earlier "× is non-native by design" was wrong: `×` is native (corecursive); only *bounded
state* fails.  The unbounded carry is the **multiplicative residue** — the part of `×` that escapes
every finite-state machine.

## Closed (was the open frontier)

1. ✅ `mulCarry (-1)(-1)` unbounded — `mulCarry_unbounded` (the carry itself, not just `mulRaw`),
   the dual of `add_carry_le_one`.
2. ✅ The carry stream `gspine (mulCarry …) : GCoShape Nat` is reached by no finite Raw —
   `carry_is_nu_escape` (`gspine_escapes` at `L = Nat`): "the multiplicative residue is a νF escape"
   is now a *theorem*, the ring-operation image of `spineL_escapes` / `object1_not_surjective`.

3. ✅ **The "one schema" question** (is there a single ∅-axiom term with `gspine_escapes` /
   `carry_is_nu_escape` / `object1_not_surjective` as instances?) — **answered YES, via a
   multi-agent dialectic** (Unifier vs Skeptic, 1 round + moderated synthesis).
   `CoResidue.escape_by_invariant` (§22) is the schema: an inhabitant lacking a property `P` that
   every cover-image has is in the image of none.  The number- and operation-carry escapes are
   *literally* this schema (`gspine_escapes_via_schema`).  **Cantor too factors through it** —
   `Lens.Cardinality.cantor_as_invariant` (machine-checked ∅-axiom), with the single
   **cover-dependent** separator `P_f φ := ∃ x, φ x = f x x`.  An earlier "Cantor is a sibling,
   not an instance / no single `P`" reading was **refuted** by this factoring.

   The genuine distinction is *not* two schemas but the **separator's self-reference**:
   *cover-independent* / intrinsic `P` (`hasFloorPath`, never mentions the cover — the residue as
   **named**) vs *cover-dependent* / self-referential `P_f` (whose escapee is forced by the cover's
   own diagonal — the residue as **reached-by-none**).  Self-reference is exactly what turns a
   *named* escape into a *reached-by-none* one; the non-surjection schema is shared.  The Skeptic's
   honest residual: `escape_by_invariant` unifies the *final non-membership step*; the diagonal
   *construction* of the self-referential `P_f` + flip escapee is the cover-dependent content it
   consumes as hypotheses — that construction is where the two registers genuinely diverge.

## Still soft-open

4. The Lens reading: addition's carry is the difference-Lens **unit** (§6.7); multiplication's carry
   a **higher** reading that escapes finite state.  A Lens-level §6.7 readout theorem would name it
   fully.  Explicit linear lower bound: `mulCarry (-1)(-1) (k+1) ≥ (k+1)(p-1)²/p` is immediate from
   `mulCarry_ge_mulRaw_div` + `mulRaw_negOne_negOne` (the carry post-`/p` is not constant-difference,
   so `positive_linear_exact` applies to `mulRaw`, not directly to `mulCarry`).

## Note — ℝ is *not* a clean not-finite-state theorem (Advance-A correction)

Investigated: ℝ's cut decision is **not** cleanly "not finite-state" the way `×` is.  `cutBits r N =
orderProj 1 (N+1) (view (r.xs N))` reads only `r.xs N` (so the "agree on the prefix, differ at N"
statement is satisfied even by a *memoryless* transducer — it does not capture not-finite-state),
and for a fixed positive real `1/(N+1) → 0` makes `cutBits r` *eventually constant*.  ℝ's
"transport-only / presentation-dependent / order-based" status is an honest *structural* observation
(kept as prose in `the_one_carrier.md`), **not** a `mulCarry_unbounded`-style theorem.  A genuine
ℝ not-finite-state result would need a transducer/unbounded-modulus framework — a larger frontier,
not a quick theorem.
