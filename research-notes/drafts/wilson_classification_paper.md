# An elementary, group-theory-free, axiom-free proof of the generalized Wilson theorem

**Draft research note / paper kernel.** Author: Mingu Jeong (theory), with machine

## 1. Statement

For `n ≥ 1` let `U(n) = {1 ≤ a ≤ n : gcd(a,n) = 1}` be the units mod `n`, and
`W(n) = ∏_{a ∈ U(n)} a (mod n)`. Gauss:

> **Theorem (generalized Wilson).** `W(n) ≡ −1 (mod n)` iff `n ∈ {1, 2, 4, pᵏ, 2pᵏ}`
> for an odd prime `p`; otherwise `W(n) ≡ +1 (mod n)`.

The case `n = p` prime is Wilson's `(p−1)! ≡ −1 (mod p)`.

## 2. The reduction to square roots of unity

Let `S(n) = {x ∈ U(n) : x² ≡ 1 (mod n)}`, the **square roots of unity**. Each
`x ∈ S(n)` is its own inverse, so in the product `W(n)` every non-self-inverse unit
cancels against its (distinct) inverse. Hence

> **Lemma 1.** `W(n) ≡ ∏_{x ∈ S(n)} x (mod n)`.

(Formalized: `WilsonGeneralization.units_prod_eq_selfinv_prod`, via an explicit
inverse-pairing involution on the residues — no quotient ring `ℤ/n`.)

So `W(n) ≡ P(n) := ∏_{x ∈ S(n)} x`, and everything reduces to the value of `P(n)`.

## 3. The value of `P(n)` — the group-theory-free argument

Note `S(n)` is closed under multiplication mod `n` and every element is an
involution. Classically `S(n) ≅ (ℤ/2)^m` and one computes `P(n)` from the *rank*
`m`. We avoid this entirely.

> **Lemma 2 (pairing-accumulation).** For any **nontrivial** `t ∈ S(n)` (`t ≠ 1`),
> `P(n) ≡ t^{|S(n)|/2} (mod n)`.

*Proof.* The map `σ_t : s ↦ st mod n` is an involution on `S(n)` (`σ_t² = id` as
`t² ≡ 1`) and is **fixed-point-free**: `s ≡ st` would give `t ≡ 1` (cancel the unit
`s`), false. So `σ_t` partitions `S(n)` into 2-element orbits `{s, st}`, of which
there are `|S(n)|/2`. Each orbit contributes `s·(st) = s²t ≡ t`. Multiplying,
`P(n) ≡ t^{|S(n)|/2}`. ∎

(Formalized: `WilsonPlusOne.prodMod_pair_accum`, a fuel recursion that peels orbits
and accumulates one factor `t` each.)

> **Proposition 3.** If `S(n)` has a square root of unity other than `±1` (i.e.
> `|S(n)| ≥ 4`), then `P(n) ≡ +1`. If `S(n) = {1, n−1}`, then `P(n) ≡ −1`.

*Proof.* Write `k = |S(n)|/2`. Since every `t ∈ S(n)` satisfies `t² ≡ 1`,
`t^k ≡ 1` if `k` is even and `t^k ≡ t` if `k` is odd.

- `S(n) = {1, n−1}`: then `P(n) = 1·(n−1) ≡ −1`.
- `|S(n)| ≥ 4`: there are two *distinct* nontrivial elements `t₁ ≠ t₂`. Lemma 2
  gives `P(n) ≡ t₁^k` and `P(n) ≡ t₂^k`. **If `k` were odd**, then `t₁ ≡ P(n) ≡ t₂`,
  contradicting `t₁ ≠ t₂`. So `k` is **even**, whence `P(n) ≡ t₁^k = (t₁²)^{k/2} ≡ 1`. ∎

The crux is the last paragraph: *the mere existence of two distinct nontrivial
square roots forces `|S(n)|/2` even*, and that — not any count of the group order —
delivers `+1`. No Lagrange, no `|S(n)| = 2^m`.

(Formalized: `WilsonValue.wilson_neg_one_of_sqrt_trivial` and
`WilsonPlusOne.wilson_plus_one_of_nontrivial_sqrt`.)

## 4. Which `n` have only `±1` as square roots of unity

> **Lemma 4.** `S(n) = {1, n−1}` (for `n > 2`) iff `n ∈ {4, pᵏ, 2pᵏ}` (odd `p`).

*`⇐`* (only `±1`):
- `n = pᵏ` (odd `p`): `x² ≡ 1` gives `pᵏ ∣ (x−1)(x+1)`. As `gcd(x−1,x+1) ∣ 2` and
  `p` is odd, the full `pᵏ` divides one factor, so `x ≡ ±1` (`SqrtOnePrimePower`,
  via the `p`-adic valuation `v_p((x−1)(x+1)) ≥ k` with one term unramified).
- `n = 2pᵏ`: `x² ≡ 1 (mod 2pᵏ)` gives `x ≡ ±1 (mod pᵏ)` (above) and `x` is odd;
  the parity selects the unique odd lift mod `2pᵏ`, again `±1` (`SqrtOneTwoPrimePower`).
- `n = 4`: direct.

*`⇒`* (a nontrivial root exists otherwise): if `n ∉ {1,2,4,pᵏ,2pᵏ}` then either
`n = 2^a` with `a ≥ 3`, where `2^{a−1}−1 ∈ S(n) ∖ {±1}`; or `n` admits a coprime
factorization `n = ab` with `a, b > 2`, where the CRT solution of `x ≡ 1 (mod a)`,
`x ≡ −1 (mod b)` lies in `S(n) ∖ {±1}` (`WilsonExistence`, via the explicit
reconstruction `crtSolve`). The case split uses one **uniform** coprime split
`(p^{v_p(n)}, n/p^{v_p(n)})` for `p = minFac(oddpart n)`; the complement is `≤ 2`
only when `n = pᵏ` or `2pᵏ`, both excluded (`WilsonClassification`).

Combining Lemma 4 with Proposition 3 gives the Theorem. ∎

## 5. The formalization (the second contribution)

The entire development is a self-contained Lean 4 arc of 7 modules under
`E213/Lib/Math/NumberTheory/` (`WilsonGeneralization`, `WilsonValue`, `WilsonPlusOne`,
`SqrtOnePrimePower`, `SqrtOneTwoPrimePower`, `WilsonExistence`, `WilsonClassification`),
totaling ~110 lemmas. Every declaration satisfies
`#print axioms <name> → "does not depend on any axioms"` — no `propext`,
`Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`, `funext`, `native_decide`, `sorry`, and no Mathlib.

Two points of formalization interest:
1. **No quotient ring.** `ℤ/n` is never constructed; all of §2–§4 is residue
   arithmetic on `Nat` with `% n`. The "units group" is the concrete coprime-residue
   list; the inverse-pairing and `σ_t`-pairing are list recursions (Lemma 1, 2).
2. **No decision on an undecidable predicate.** The final `iff`
   (`prod_units_neg_one_iff`) would naively `by_cases` on `PrimitiveRootModulus n`,
   which is not decidable as stated and would import `Classical.choice`. Instead a
   *constructive dichotomy* `classify n : PrimitiveRootModulus n ∨ W(n) ≡ +1` is
   proved by exhibiting, for every `n`, either a primitivity witness or a nontrivial
   square root — keeping the whole theorem axiom-free.

## 6. Why this fits the broader program

This sits inside a larger axiom-free corpus (DRLT/213, ~2000 Lean modules) governed
by a *forcing-vs-bookkeeping* discipline: a classical theorem's ∅-axiom re-derivation
is *evidential* only when the constraint forces a structurally different, more
explicit proof. Generalized Wilson is a clean instance — the `+1` case's standard
proof leans on group structure (`|S| = 2^m`), and removing all axioms (in particular,
having no abstract finite-group library to lean on) forced the elementary
`P ≡ t^{|S|/2}` route, which is arguably the more transparent argument and is the
paper's mathematical kernel.

## Status / next steps
- [ ] Literature check on the `P = t^{|S|/2}` / "no Lagrange" Wilson `+1` argument
      (owe a search; `deep-research` can do this).
- [ ] Tighten §4's `⇒` exposition (the uniform `minFac(oddpart n)` split).
- [ ] Decide framing: *Monthly*-style elementary note vs. ITP/CPP formalization paper
      (the two contributions can be split or combined).
