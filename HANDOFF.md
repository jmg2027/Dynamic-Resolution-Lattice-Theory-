# Session Handoff — 2026-06-16 (multi-agent debate marathon)

## Branch
`claude/frontier-research-agents-h5okq9` — pushed, ahead of `origin/main`.
Authoritative build `cd lean && lake build E213.Lib` → **green (1959 modules)**.
Strict ∅-axiom intact: every theorem added this session is `#print axioms`-empty.

## What Was Done This Session

A continuous **multi-agent debate marathon**: panels (proposer / skeptic /
synthesizer) on seven high-value / high-difficulty frontiers, each returning the
sharpest insight + one ∅-axiom buildable brick + the honest wall.  Six new bricks
+ one honesty correction landed PURE; all integrated into the green `E213.Lib`.

### Bricks landed (all `#print axioms` → empty)

1. **Yang–Mills confinement — spectral face** (`Lib/Physics/YangMills/ColoredGap.lean`).
   `colored_form_identity`: explicit SOS certificate for the operator `Δ₀² − massGap·Δ₀`,
   `⟨Δ₀f,Δ₀f⟩ − 4⟨Δ₀f,f⟩ = 2·(2(f₀+f₁+f₂) − 3(f₃+f₄))² + 6·(f₃−f₄)²` for every config.
   The two squares are exactly the gapped `vTop` (λ=10) and `vTemp` (λ=6) directions.
   `colored_rayleigh_ge` (the operator inequality `Δ₀(Δ₀−massGap·I)⪰0`), `colored_gap`
   (via `lichnerowicz_abstract`, **every colored eigenmode has λ ≥ massGap = 4**).
   Closes angle 1 of `yang_mills_confinement.md`.

2. **Atom-forcing criterion — the kernel** (`Meta/AxisSeparation.lean`).
   `subsingleton_iff_collapses`: the one-hot readout collapses ⟺ the atom axis is a
   subsingleton — the checkable form of "faithful ⟺ distinguishing".  (Corrected the
   panel's first-draft `iff`, which was vacuously false at the subsingleton pole.)

3. **Lorentz metric signature** (`Lib/Physics/Mixing/LorentzSignature.lean`).
   `lorentz_signature_one_three`: `diag(−1,+1,+1,+1)`, signature `(1,3)` via orthogonal
   basis + `det≠0`, sourced `neg=NT−1`, `pos=NS`, `dim=NS+(NT−1)`.  Killed the wrong
   `⋆²`-eigenvalue route (`⋆²=−1` is `(4,0)`, not Lorentzian).  Advances open #4 below.

4. **Chebyshev ψ-lower, base √2→2** (`MultSystemValue.lean`, `ChebyshevLower.lean`).
   `four_pow_le_succ_mul_central_binom` (`4ⁿ ≤ (2n+1)·C(2n,n)`) and `four_pow_le_lcm_mul`
   (`4ⁿ ≤ (2n+1)·lcm(1..2n)`, the textbook `ψ(2n) ≥ 2n·ln2 − ln(2n+1)`).

5. **Markov strip-reframe cap** (`Real213/Markov/MarkovUniqueness.lean`).
   `proper_divisor_of_zhang_modulus_lt_two_c`: every proper divisor of `3c±2` is `< 2c`
   ⇒ `3c±2` is the **terminal** parametric family (a map cap, not a kernel advance).

6. **ζ(3) numerator — harmonic recurrence over the genuine lcm³** (`Zeta3Numerator.lean`).
   `harmonic_recurrence_lcm`: instantiates `harmonic_part_recurrence` at `ℓ = lcm(1..N)³`,
   discharging both divisibility hypotheses via `cube_dvd_lcm_cube`.

### Wave 2 bricks (second debate round)

7. **Hodge conjecture for T⁴ — the biconditional** (`Cohomology/Surfaces/AbelianSurfaceHodge.lean`).
   `hodge11_iff_algebraic` + `neron_severi_T4`: `IsHodge11 F ↔ IsAlgebraic F`
   (`NS(T⁴)=H^{1,1}∩H²`, full Lefschetz (1,1) for `T⁴`) + rank-`4` ℤ-independent
   generator basis + the genuine gap `H^{1,1}⊊H²`.  ∅-axiom-decidable (fixed rational `J`).

8. **Metric signature wiring** (`Physics/Mixing/LorentzSignature.lean`).
   `time_axis_is_order2_via_NT`: the negative axis is canonically the `NT`-sourced
   order-2 (`i`) axis — count `NT−1`, tied to `NT²=4` and `Λ¹ ⋆²=−1` by shared source.
   Honest scope: the strong "MUST be the `⋆²=−1` carrier" is unreachable (`⋆²` is
   uniform `(4,0)` on `Λ¹`).

Honesty fix: `gravity_reconnection_hinge_holonomy.md` cited the **deleted**
`GravityShadow.lean`; corrected with the panel verdict ("gravity = real part" is a
relabeling; standing walls recorded).

### Wave 3 bricks (third debate round)

9. **Hodge-index theorem for T⁴** (`Cohomology/Surfaces/AbelianSurfaceHodge.lean`).
   `cupT4_nsComb`: `Q(nsComb a b c d) = 2(ab − c² − d²)` (general); `hodge_index_signature_T4`:
   orthogonal basis with one `+2` (the ample polarization) and three `−2` ⇒ signature
   `(1,3)` on the rank-4 Néron–Severi lattice — completes the T⁴ Hodge package.

Conceptual yield (Millennium triage panel): the no-witness wall is a **trichotomy** —
(1) signed cancellation (RH, BSD, NS vortex term), (2) uniformity over an unbounded
descent (Markov-H, Collatz, P-vs-NP), (3) **two-Lens interaction** (abc, deep BSD: the
witness would have to count across the `+`/`×` independence the repo *proves* via
`vp_separation` — a heuristic obstruction made structural).  Top buildable frontiers
surfaced: **Bertrand's postulate** (reachable; keystone = primorial bound `∏_{p≤N} p ≤ 4ⁿ`,
~1 week) and the **Selberg sieve SOS positivity** (same shape as `colored_confinement_master`).

### Wave 4 bricks (Bertrand infrastructure — autonomous)

10. **★ Primorial bound `∏_{p≤N} p ≤ 4ᴺ` — CLOSED ∅-axiom** (Erdős's Bertrand keystone).
    `Primorial.primorial_le_four_pow` (PURE), built on the full chain landed this session:
    - `primesIn_split` + `listProd_append` (`MultSystemValue.lean`) — the Erdős window split.
    - `binom_eq_choose` (`BinomChooseBridge.lean`) — Lens `binom` = Lib `choose` (identical
      Pascal recursion; resolves the layer/def hazard via the `Lens.Number` umbrella).
    - `odd_central_binom_le : C(2m+1,m) ≤ 4^m` (`OddCentralBinom.lean`) — `choose_symm` +
      `pascal_row_sum` + sum helpers + `four_pow_eq`.
    - `prime_dvd_odd_binom` + `window_prod_le_odd` + `primorial_le_four_pow` (`Primorial.lean`)
      — the vp divisibility (over the `fact=factorial` bridge), the window bound, the parity
      strong-induction.
    A famous theorem, ∅-axiom.  Remaining for *full* Bertrand (roadmap
    `research-notes/frontiers/bertrand_postulate.md`): the `(2n/3,n]` vanishing window, the
    prime-range partition + `√`-tail, the crossover past `N₀≈468`, the finite prime chain.

### Honesty correction (wave 1)
`research-notes/frontiers/rebuild_roadmaps/proton_electron_ratio_rebuild.md` —
the Stage-1 bracket claim was **numerically false** (`6π⁵ ∈ (1835.60, 1839.82)`
from `π∈(311/99,22/7)` pins no consecutive integers).  Corrected; `6π⁵` recorded
as numerology (only `6 = NS·NT` is atomic; the `π⁵` exponent has two mutually
inconsistent in-repo justifications) per the derive-don't-reconcile discipline.

### Main conceptual yield — the no-witness duality
`research-notes/frontiers/multi_agent_marathon_2026_06_16.md`.  Two panels (RH and
Markov) independently hit the same wall shape: **a conjecture is ∅-axiom-reachable in
213 exactly when its content has a count-Lens (finite/unsigned/local) witness, and
walled when its content is a *cancellation* (RH: signed sum `M(N)=Σμ`, "signed-
cancellation has no count-Lens witness") or a *uniformity over unbounded descent*
(Markov: "the uniform residue has no local witness").**  Same wall, two readings.

## Current Precision Results (0 free parameters)
| Observable | DRLT | Observed | Error |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1/α_em` ×10⁹ | 137,035,999,111 | 137,035,999,084 | 27×10⁻⁹ ≈ 0.2 ppb |
YM mass gap `= c·min(NS,NT) = 4 > 0` (PURE); **colored modes gapped λ ≥ 4** (new).

## Open Problems (Priority Order)
1. **YM confinement angle 2** (Wilson-loop area law) — honest wall: no embedding on
   `K_{3,2}` ⇒ no enclosed "area"/string tension; holonomy machinery proves the ℕ⁺
   sector loop-free.  No internal handle found yet.
2. **ζ(3) numerator — kernel recurrence** — no clean WZ certificate (harmonic factor
   leaves the proper-hypergeometric class); multi-session by hand.  `zeta3_wz/numerator_plan.md`.
3. **Metric signature** — `(1,3)` form built; deriving *which* axis is the `−` (vs a
   reading) and wiring to `⋆²=−1` is the next positive step.
4. **PNT constant = 1 / RH** — walled (the no-witness duality above); only bracket
   sharpening is ∅-axiom (`four_pow_le_lcm_mul` is the latest rung).
5. **Markov `H`** — terminal; `3c±2` now provably the last linear-invariant family.

## Notes for next session
- `ring_intZ` compares canonical forms and chokes on `0+`/`0*` noise — pre-strip with
  pure `Meta.Int213.{zero_add,zero_mul,add_comm}` (the core `Int.zero_add` etc. carry
  `propext`).  `simp`/`simp only` inject `propext` — avoid; use `rw`/`decide`/`rfl`.
- `decide` refuses goals with free variables (a guard) — use explicit Nat lemmas.
- Core Nat lemmas that carry `propext`/`Classical`: `Nat.lt_of_mul_lt_mul_left`,
  `Nat.sub_pos_of_lt`, `Nat.le_sub_of_add_le`.  Pure replacements exist / derive easily.
- Full `E213.Lib` build exceeds a single 600s timeout when a deep module (e.g.
  `MultSystemValue`) is touched; it resumes from cache on a second invocation.
