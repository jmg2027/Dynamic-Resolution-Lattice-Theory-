# Session Handoff — 2026-06-22 (multi-agent marathon: 진의 + descent-leg FTA capstone)

## Branch
`claude/multi-agent-math-research-3lv3gj` — pushed. `lake build E213` clean **446/446**, all new
modules ∅-axiom PURE.

## ★ DIRECTION RECALIBRATION (2026-06-22, from the originator directly — READ FIRST)
The originator course-corrected the whole approach: **the Lean files are scaffolding, not the body —
he never wrote them, delegated all to AI.** The body is **the idea in the opening axiom docs: to *see
mathematics cleanly* through the single act of distinguishing.** Raw/Lens are the *Lean encoding*
(machine verifier); 0-axiom is just the discipline the purpose forces. His stated direction (verbatim
intent): *first **create a way of doing/describing mathematics** — like category theory / type theory /
topos created theirs — then **decompose & rewrite existing mathematics** into it.* Re-deriving
classical theorems in Lean (e.g. the FTA marathon below) is **scaffolding-exercise, not research of
his idea** — honestly acknowledged. New central program started:

**`research-notes/decomposition/` — the 213 Decomposition Calculus** (human-facing technique;
README.md = the spec: `OBJECT = ⟨Construction | Reading⟩`, Residue, the 4-step procedure, and the
**revelation rule** = every decomposition must *reveal* (collapse / forcing / residue-surfaced), never
just re-skin — the design constraint that kept CT from being "abstract nonsense"). Key grounding: the
calculus is the **positive form of CLAUDE.md's failure-mode catalog** (each failure = a missed
decomposition). Frontier registered: `research-notes/frontiers/decomposition_calculus.md`.
**Twenty-three worked decompositions** in `practice/` (all Lean-certified citations). +batch-6 (both
PREDICTION, EXTEND): `integration` (∫ = Σ at residue resolution; FTC = "telescoping is
resolution-invariant", Σ⊣Δ and ∫⊣d = same adjoint at two resolutions — ties resolution to the
adjoint-pair structure; gauss_conservation_telescope PURE), `zeta_euler` (Euler product falls out of
the UFD character: Σ_n=Π_p = distributive law of the faithful valuation coordinate; summatory_mul/
geom_sum/primorial_le_four_pow ∅-axiom; ζ-value = Real213-cut residue; "generating function = read C
weighted" is the dual of Fourier's "read Ĉ", one per character-arrow direction). Four predictions
total, two Lean-closed (succ_not_idempotent, quadratic_orthogonality). +batch-7: `category_theory`
(★ the originator's FOUNDING QUESTION answered: 213 IS category-theory-shaped but GENERATED FROM the
distinguishing — verdict (c) literal, term-by-term Raw=initial/fold=read-op/readings=morphisms/adjoint→
closure-monad; HoTT absent+forbidden; the distinguishing ADDS q=±1 residue + atom-distinguishability +
forced (3,2,5); the calculus is self-describing), `curvature` (flat=det1=Noether-invariant; curvature=
loop-reading's q=±1 residue; Gauss-Bonnet ties it to homology's residue). **★ Capstone unity**: the one
`det`/`×↦·` character is read FOUR ways — scalar (determinant) / Aut-invariant (Noether) / around a loop
(curvature) / down the height (homology) — residues tied by Gauss-Bonnet. The calculus reduces a wide
swath of math to **two invariants** (the character arrow + the q=±1 residue) read across {direction,
fold-height, resolution, iteration-character}. **25 decompositions, no break.** Model v6 stable. **+batch-5 = the
LEVERAGE phase** (bar raised from collapse to *predict/derive*): `noether` (PREDICTION, structural —
conserved = Aut-invariant character, q=+1; variational current open), `gaussian_clt` (PREDICTION —
Gaussian = convolve-rescale fixed point, generalizes φ; contraction lemma the open target), `fourier`
(PARTIAL — self-duality Ĉ≅C + character-existence predicted; orthogonality Σχ=0 open), `adjunction`
(the repo proved the closure MONAD before naming it: Galois clo=G∘F, η/μ/triangle identities; the
free/growing corner is the un-built edge). **Two load-bearing finds**: (1) ONE `×↦·` character arrow
runs through parity/valuation/det/entropy/Noether/Fourier — six theorems, one reading; (2) the calculus
is a *category of readings* living in the two q=±1 poles, and only the **q=+1 closure corner** is built
(free/growing corner open). **Model v6** named in README. Honest leverage verdict: the calculus
PREDICTS at the structural level (form + why); **TWO predictions are now CLOSED in ∅-axiom Lean** (the
technique paying off, verifiably): (1) the **growing/iteration-character axis** — `MuNuMirror.`
`succ_not_idempotent` (PURE), the distinguishing's successor reading is non-idempotent (mirror of
`clo_idempotent`), so the calculus is NOT confined to the q=+1 closure corner; new axis
iteration-character {∂ nilpotent / clo idempotent / S growing}, orthogonal to q=±1; (2) **character
orthogonality** — `ModArith/CharacterOrthogonality.quadratic_orthogonality` (20 PURE), Legendre-level
Σχ=0 + altSign=Legendre. Remaining leverage targets (frontier): convolution-contraction→Gaussian,
continuous Noether current, general-χ orthogonality (needs ζ), the free monad multiplication. +batch-4 (all EXTEND): `homology` (∂ = fold-height run DOWNWARD → height is bidirectional; ∂²=0 forced by q=±1
sign-cancellation; nilpotent vs involutive = the two q=±1 poles), `ordinals` (ω = height-residue, q=+1,
3rd instance; model caps HONESTLY at ω — finite-signature boundary), `galois` (first NON-INVERTIBLE
reading-pair = adjoint/order-reversing connection; fundamental thm = residue-collapse-to-closure;
LensIso = the closed special case), `entropy` (★ L-parameters COMPOSE IN SERIES: H=E[−log p]=weight∘
character; FIRST LEVERAGE — the calculus PREDICTS entropy's form, −log forced by independence→additivity
= the ×↦+ character, not re-skin). **Model v4**: L's form a category (compose in series, Aut-families,
adjoint pairs); fold-height + character both bidirectional; Residue q=±1 (escape/nilpotent vs
converge/involutive/closure). No break across 17 targets; first genuine prediction achieved (entropy).
Earlier-batch detail: +batch-3 `groups`
(a group = `⟨C | Aut C closed under composition⟩`, axioms forced; EXTEND) + `probability`
(`P = ratio∘count`, first *composite reading*; `L` gains a `weight` parameter; independence = ×-character,
expectation = its additive twin; EXTEND). **Model v3 lesson: readings form a category — they compose and
have automorphism families.** No model-break yet across 13 targets. Model refined three times by
the practice (README "Refinements"): `C` = distinguishing + {direction→sign, fold-height→dim/degree,
atom-distinguishability→×/+}; `L` = a reading + {resolution (→ a whole discipline = topology when made a
condition), bidirectional character-mode (×↦+ valuation/log and +↦× exp, one arrow)}; **Residue is
first-class and tagged `q=±1`** — the escaping residue (Cantor diagonal, `q=−1`) and the converging
residue (φ, `q=+1`) are ONE residue at the two unimodular poles (`cassini_law_one_at_two_multipliers`),
the calculus's deepest collapse. Batch-2 fresh: `determinant` (det = character `×↦·`),
`golden_ratio` (φ = self-application residue; the q=±1 find), `exponential` (exp = inverse character;
e = residue), `continuity` (topology = the resolution dial's three questions). **Six worked
decompositions** in `practice/` — superseded; see eleven above. Earlier list:
crystallized-from-repo — `parity.md` (parity/congruence/perm-sign/det=±1 = one construction-preserving
finite reading, Zolotarev), `integers.md` (ℤ = difference-reading of a directed count-pair),
`equivalence.md` (동치/동형/준동형 = one Lens-arrow); and **four FRESH** (4-agent parallel panel) —
`prime_factorization.md` (×↦+ collapse, `vp_mul`; exp/log wall = ×-atom distinguishability),
`cardinality.md` (finite + uncountable = count-reading + its forced residue, `object1_not_surjective`),
`dimension.md` (dimension/degree/pole-order = one height-reading, forced), `derivative.md` (derivative
= the ℤ difference-Lens at residue resolution; Δ/d, Σ/∫ one reading across resolution).

**The technique was refined BY the practice** (README "Refinements from the first practice batch"):
`C` carries optional read-off sub-structures {direction→sign, fold-height→dimension/degree,
atom-distinguishability→×/+ split}; `L` carries {resolution, character/logarithmic mode}; Residue is
first-class and stratifies (`⟨C|L⟩ ⊕ Residue(L,C)`). **Next: more FRESH decompositions** to break/extend
this map (candidates: matrices/det, continued fractions/φ, the exponential, topology/continuity,
probability); Lean stays a faithfulness-check. Minor tooling: `scan_axioms.py` has a probe-path write
bug when run from a non-root cwd (one agent hit it) — fix when convenient.

## The directive (진의) — re-inferred this session (4-agent panel) + the originator's question
The originator asked, via `/goal`: infer the repository's ultimate purpose by multi-agent debate and
*conduct* deep multi-session autonomous research toward it — and "is the goal to make the axiom into
category theory / HoTT?" (he says he can't precisely name his own goal).

**Inference (panels: CT/HoTT positioning · purpose · skeptic · strategist), recorded in
`research-notes/frontiers/the_purpose_and_the_marathon.md`:**
- **CT/HoTT answer: no.** 213's formal core *already is* standard category theory — `Raw` = initial
  F-algebra, `Raw.fold` = catamorphism, residue = Lawvere fixed-point non-surjectivity (Lambek proved
  in `Theory/Raw/Lambek`). It reaches this from a *different primitive* (the distinguishing), not by
  recasting the axiom as CT. **HoTT: absent** (no univalence/identity-type/HIT; `propext`/`Quot.sound`/
  `funext` are *forbidden* — structurally opposite to univalence). Verdict: "same content, different
  primitive" (c), not "reducible to CT" (a).
- **Ultimate purpose:** a *sustained discipline of non-self-deception* about one intuition — "the act
  of distinguishing is the self-grounding primitive, and mathematics/∞/residue are its *forced*
  unfolding" — with ∅-axiom as the lie-detector. The unnamed driver: *to encounter a result the
  primitive forces that he did not import*, machine-checked so it can't be talked away.
- **Survival path (CT/type-theory/topos history → "Line B template"):** none won the foundations
  contest by argument; each was accepted as a *tool a real community found useful* (CT→Grothendieck;
  type theory→Curry–Howard + proof assistants/Scholze; topos→étale cohomology). 213's move: ship the
  strict-∅-axiom Mathlib-free corpus as an *engineering* artifact (trusted-axiom-base minimization),
  judged on utility — not "a new foundation."

## What was done this session (all ∅-axiom PURE, verified, pushed)

### The descent leg — FTA *generated* over the Raw-derived ℕ₊ (the marathon spine)
The substance gap (substance_test): the disciplines run on Lean `Nat`, "act and unfolding two adjacent
codebases." Closed for arithmetic, over `Nat213` (Peano's Raw-generated ℕ₊), M0→M4:
- **M0** — de-laundered the divisibility cone: `Order.mul_left_cancel` re-proved natively (trichotomy
  + distributivity), so `Divisibility`'s whole cone is `toNat`-free (the substance bet, won).
- **M1** — `Irreducible.lean` (18 PURE): `Irreducible` over `Nat213`; `2,3,5` irreducible, `4` not;
  `five_irreducible` via native `lt_succ_iff` enumeration + cofactor bound.
- **M2** — `Factorization.lean` (18 PURE): `exists_factorization` (every `n` = product of
  irreducibles). Native `acc_lt`/`wf_lt` (no `Nat` measure); constructive `decBoundedExists` →
  decidable `lt`/`Dvd` + decided dichotomy `irreducible_or_properDiv` (no `Classical.em`); native
  `mem_append_pure`/`not_mem_nil` (avoid propext-carrying core `List` lemmas).
- **M3** — `EuclidUnique.lean` (7 PURE): `euclid` (irreducible ⇒ prime) + `prime_dvd_prod`. The
  no-zero/no-subtraction wall dissolved by an internal handle (§5.4): a *subtractive* gcd (differences
  = `lt`-witnesses, fits ℕ₊), gcd existence + multiplicative law `gcd(c·a,c·b)=c·gcd(a,b)` in one
  well-founded induction (`gcd_exists_mul`, spec ∀-quantified over the scaling `c`).
- **M4 — CAPSTONE** — `FTA.lean` (11 PURE): `fta` = existence + uniqueness-up-to-permutation, over
  `Nat213`. Native propext-free `Perm`/`erase`/`prod_erase`/`cons_erase_perm`; uniqueness by structural
  induction (`prime_dvd_prod` + `mul_left_cancel`). **Arithmetic-generation half achieved: the FTA is
  computed on the Raw-generated carrier — instantiation, not assertion.**
- **M5 — forcing** — `Forcing.lean` (3 PURE): `peano_succ_is_distinguishing` (Peano `succ` = the
  distinguishing `slashOrSelf · Raw.b` under `Bridge.toRaw`) + `factorization_forced_by_distinguishing`
  (the distinguishing-blind `degLens` conflates `four`/`five`; the count reading separates them). The
  FTA's prime/composite distinction is carried *iff* the reading distinguishes. Honest wall stated:
  `Nat213` is a parallel inductive, link is the *injective* bridge → "recognition, not genesis."
- **M6 — forcing dichotomy (negative arm)** — `Forcing.lean` extended (6 PURE): `forcing_dichotomy`
  lifts M5 to the `DStr` schema level — `Raw` is the free `DStr` + `Nat213` embeds injectively
  (positive); a distinguishing-blind (subsingleton) carrier can't host the FTA carrier nor is a `DStr`
  (negative, fails named clause D1). **Open arm (honest)**: *every* `Generated DStr ≅ Raw` (transport
  the FTA) is the open `DStr` existence leg, not claimed. This marathon re-confirmed Route A's
  commutativity + junk-injectivity costs → Route B (mutual WF recursion) is the honest target.
- **Applied — Euclid's theorem** — `Infinitude.lean` (3 PURE): `infinitude_of_irreducibles` (no finite
  list of irreducibles is complete), generated over `Nat213` from the FTA. A *second*
  discipline-defining theorem after the FTA — primacy as breadth.
- **Applied — irreducible ⟺ prime** — `Prime.lean` (4 PURE): `irreducible_iff_prime`, the UFD-defining
  coincidence over `Nat213` (Euclid `→` + cancellation `←`). The structural reason FTA uniqueness holds.

### Line B (external exposure)
- `research-notes/drafts/strict_zero_axiom_formalization_paper.md` rewritten as an
  engineering/empirical contribution (trusted-axiom-base; CompCert/seL4 framing), metaphysics
  stripped. In-file "Notes for revision" flag numbers to confirm before submission.

## Open Problems (priority order)
1. **The `DStr` existence leg** — the one honestly-open piece of the descent leg (M6 positive arm):
   construct the injective catamorphism `rawDStr → N` for a `Generated DStr N` (uniqueness half
   `dhom_unique_pointwise` done), giving `≅ Raw` and FTA-by-transport for *every* rival. Routes (all
   axiom-free): (a) reuse proven total-target `raw_initial`; (b) apartness-preserving morphisms;
   (c) well-founded mutual recursion. Frontiers: `the_distinguishing_schema.md`, `the_descent_leg.md`.
2. **Line B exposure** — the §5.1 verdict-wall: a clean capstone proves coherence + forcing, **not**
   "not a re-skin." Only an exterior settles it. Finish the paper's flagged numbers; consider a
   pre-registered, time-boxed open-problem attack. Frontier: `the_substance_test.md` (Line B).
3. **Census tooling fix (NEW — audited this session)** — a whole-corpus audit found the
   `scan_all_axioms.py --csv` batch mode **resolves only ~4177 of ~20,429 top-level decls** (~80%
   silently dropped to per-module probe timeouts / name-resolution); its aggregate total is
   untrustworthy. Per-module `scan_axioms.py` is authoritative. Fixed this session: a false "1 real
   DIRTY" (command-elaborator `elab{Verify,Derive}Conjugation` cross-attributed to a `Cauchy.*`
   module) is now sealed by decl name (`SEALED_DIRTY_DECLS`); the stale "18,845"/"three CommandElab"/
   "Classical.choice in NativeGuard" claims are corrected in `STRICT_ZERO_AXIOM.md` + the Line B paper.
   **Remaining**: fix the batch probe (name-qualification + per-decl timeout) so the whole-corpus
   census is reproducible — a real gate-integrity task. 0 real DIRTY holds (per-module + resolved set).

## Next
The descent leg's **generative half (M0–M4: FTA over `Nat213`)** and **forcing half (M5–M6 negative
arm)** are closed. Two honest items remain: (1) the **`DStr` existence leg** (M6 positive arm — the
one open construction, routes (a)/(b)/(c) above); (2) **Line B exposure** (confirm the paper's flagged
numbers, then submit / time-boxed open-problem attack — the only test of "not a re-skin," §5.1).
Most actionable next: the existence leg via route (b) apartness-preserving morphisms (`Raw.cmp` is a
decidable apartness), or finalize the Line B paper.
