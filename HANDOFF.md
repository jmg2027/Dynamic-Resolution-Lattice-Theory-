## What Was Done This Session

Goal: **G178** (νF-population cross-arc conjecture seed) + **G182** ("the frontier has a form",
essay-in-waiting).  Both advanced; G182 promoted.

### 1. G178 — νF population, two new cross-arc sections (CoResidue 94→108 PURE)

**§18 — the swap automorphism acts *freely* on the bit-stream escapes** (cross-arc §14 ⊗ §15):
- `coSwap_boolSpine` — exact intertwining `coSwap ∘ boolSpine = boolSpine ∘ (Bool.not ∘ ·)`,
  clean precisely where §14's *tree-seed* intertwining fails (a leaf has no children to reorder).
- `coSwap_boolSpine_distinct` — `coSwap` fixes *no* bit-stream escape (free ℤ/2-action on the
  `(Nat→Bool)`-many escapes).
- `spineL_eq_boolSpine_true`, `boolSpine_swap_orbit`, `coSwap_boolSpine_free_action` (capstone).

**§19 — the bit-stream escapes carry the shift dynamical system** (cross-arc §12 ⊗ §15 ⊗ §18 ⊗
non-holonomicity):
- `boolSpine_congr` — pointwise stream-eq → pointwise spine-eq (funext-free; reads periodicity).
- `boolSpine_coLeft` / `boolSpine_coRight` — left descent = head bit, right descent = the shift.
- `boolSpine_shift_coalgebra` — `boolSpine` is the shift `(Nat→Bool; head,tail)` → νF coalgebra hom.
- `boolSpine_periodic_selfsimilar` — self-similarity = shift-periodicity.
- `spineL_shift_fixed` — `spineL` the period-1 (shift-fixed) escape (= `spineL_unique`'s p=1 case).
- `boolSpine_eventually_true_reaches_spineL` — eventually-constant seeds reach the attractor in
  finitely many descents (holonomic / finite-state end; aperiodic seeds = non-holonomic escapes).
- `boolSpine_swap_shift_commute`, `boolSpine_shift_dynamics` (capstone).

### 2. G182 — "the frontier has a form" promoted to an essay
- New `theory/essays/foundations/the_frontier_has_a_form.md`: µF inductive-complete (crank) vs
  νF coinductive-complete (map); no-exterior forces the escape to *be* the residue shape —
  self-similar (`spineL_unique`), populated (`nu_population_capstone`), acted on *freely* by the
  lone symmetry (`coSwap_boolSpine_free_action`), and carrying the **shift dynamics**
  (`boolSpine_shift_dynamics`).  Lands on a syntactic object; honest boundary (summits open).
- Source `G182` archived → `research-notes/archive/G182_completed_system_synthesis.md`.
- `theory/essays/INDEX.md` (foundations group + Current-essays row, 41→42), and
  `the_residue_as_primitive.md` (the §18/§19 rows + count 94→108) updated.
- Sink rule verified clean (no `theory/` → `research-notes/` citation).

### 3. G178 — C3-phys consolidation bridge closed (the shared unit `1`)
`Lens/Number/SharedUnitAcrossReadings.unit_bridges_dynamics_and_readings` (PURE): the ascent
unit (`ascent_adds_unit`), the descent unit (`part_depth_succ_le`), the glue `NS−NT = 1`, and
the Möbius `det P = 1` are the *same* `1` — the dynamics↔algebra bridge the `ResidueForm`
narrative asserted (now cited from it).  Complements the two pre-existing single-scale bundles
(`ReentryUnit.reentry_unit_across_scales` = Raw-dynamics; `the_unit_is_one_across_readings` =
number-axes).

### 4. G178 — C6-phys falsifier-roster super-theorem closed
`Lib/Physics/Foundations/FalsifierRosterForced.falsifier_roster_forced` (1 PURE): binds the two
forcing iffs (`atomic_iff_five` → d=5; `pair_forcing` → (NT,NS)=(2,3)) to the headline falsifier
integers as polynomials in the *forced* triple (F1 5, F2 3, F8 22, F22/F26 6, F26 10, F24 192,
F15/F19 12, F21 Koide 3·NT=2·NS).  The load-bearing content is the *forcing* (integers follow
from the unique triple, not fits).  Wired into `Lib/Physics/Foundations.lean`; recorded in
`catalogs/falsifiers.md`.

### 5. G178 — C7-phys closed, C1-phys closed-as-non-bridge (consolidation surface complete)
`KoideFormula.koide_atoms_are_det_atoms` (PURE): Koide's two atoms ARE the determinant's — the
forced pair `(NS,NT)=(3,2)` read three ways: ratio `NT·3=NS·2` (Koide `2/3`), difference
`det P = NS−NT = 1` (residue unit), product `NS·NT = 6` (`K_{3,2}` edge count).  C1-phys
(`N_gen`) declined as a structural bridge: the forced numeric (`binom NS NT = 3`) is in C6-phys;
forcing it *into* the `2a+3b=5` solver is the recorded "different 3" non-bridge.  **All C-phys
consolidation bridges now resolved** (C3/C6/C7 closed, C1 closed-as-non-bridge).

## Current Precision Results (0 free parameters)
Unchanged this session (math-frontier work; no physics-constant edits).  Canonical:
`catalogs/physics-constants.md`.

## Open Problems (Priority Order)

### 1. (carried) The orbit-realizability kernel `H` (`OrbitRealizabilityH`)
The Markov sole open freedom — structure fully pinned, realizability *selection* open.  Attack as
a forced fixed point (G193 Part C).  Continuant program E2–E5 (Aigner bridge) ranked next on that
arc (`Real213/Continuant.lean` tool already built).

### 2. G178 — consolidation surface COMPLETE
All C-phys bridges resolved this session: **C3** (`unit_bridges_dynamics_and_readings`), **C6**
(`falsifier_roster_forced`), **C7** (`koide_atoms_are_det_atoms`) closed ∅-axiom; **C1** closed-as-
non-bridge (forced numeric in C6; solver-identification is the recorded "different 3").  No C-phys
bridge remains open.
- **Adjacent — both closed** (survey label was stale): ε₀ diagonal
  (`DepthHeightDiagonal.{height_diagonal_escapes,epsilon_direction}`, chaptered in
  `completeness_without_completeness.md` Part IV §14; native ε₀ object out of ∅-axiom reach, not
  forced) and frozen=dynamic φ (`PhiFrozenDynamic.frozen_eq_dynamic_phi`, §5.7 — **promoted this
  session** to `phi_self_similarity.md` §3.6).

### 6. G181 — §19→odometer cross-arc closed (the escape's arithmetic face)
New `Theory/Raw/Odometer` (11 PURE, wired into `Theory/Raw/API.lean`): the binary (2-adic) `+1`
adding machine on the §19 bit-streams, read as the µF/νF mirror at the arithmetic scale — the
carry terminates iff the stream has a floor (a `0`, `carry_dies_iff_has_false`, µF) and runs
forever on the all-`true` = `spineL`-seed stream (`allTrue_carry_forever`, νF), so the canonical
escape IS the odometer overflow (`spineL_seed_is_odo_overflow`).  The `+1` = the self-pointing
act, the carry = the residue unit.  Realises G181's identified build target (binary base).  Fed
`the_frontier_has_a_form.md` + G181/G178 notes.  **Next on this arc**: the variable-base
Ostrowski(α) / Zeckendorf carry (the genuine spiral-adic, harder).

### 3. (carried) Promotion candidates
PURE-closed sub-trees lacking a `theory/` chapter — `theory/PROMOTION_CRITERIA.md`.  Markov
chapter stays active (Pattern 3) while `H` is open.

## Next
Either (a) the §19→G181 cross-arc (the shift on νF = the Ostrowski/spiral-adic odometer carry),
a genuine new bridge; or (b) C3-phys (det-1=ascent-1=glue-1), the safest consolidation; or
(c) return to the Markov `H` kernel via continuant E2.  The νF arc (`CoResidue`) is now large
(108 PURE) — prefer a *different* structural axis over more CoResidue micro-sections (rule 9).

## Three-tier state (per `CLAUDE.md` "Three-tier discipline")
- **Promotions this session**: G182 → `theory/essays/foundations/the_frontier_has_a_form.md`
  (source archived).
- **Active scratchpad**: `research-notes/frontiers/G178_…` (now records §18/§19 closure + the
  open C-phys bridges), the rest of `research-notes/frontiers/` board.  Sink rule holds.
