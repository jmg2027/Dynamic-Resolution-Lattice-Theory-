# Session Handoff — 2026-06-04 (post-merge: residue-unit odometer theory → main)

## Branch
`main` — the feature branch `claude/math-frontier-research-6Bw68` is **merged**
(`--no-ff` commit `536031359`) and pushed.  `cd lean && lake build E213` ✓ (303
modules, fresh `rm -rf .lake/build` build clean).  Working tree clean.

This session built a complete ∅-axiom theory of the **residue unit `+1`** (the
act of pointing as an arithmetic dynamical system) and merged it into the
re-architected main (which had advanced +50 commits with the p-adic /
universal-Betti / geometrization work — all preserved through the merge).

## What Was Done This Session

### 1. The residue unit `+1` as a complete dynamical theory (∅-axiom)
- **`Theory/Raw/Odometer`** (41 PURE) — the binary `+1` adding machine on the
  bit-stream escape space (`CoResidue`): §1 carry/escape (µF/νF mirror, the
  canonical escape `spineL` IS the overflow); §2 successor dynamics (`+1`
  injective = `tower_no_cycle`, the descent–increment skew `shift_odo`); §3 the
  `ℤ`-action (`+1` invertible via the predecessor `−1`/borrow, `odo_unit_action`);
  §4 reversibility asymmetry (descent forgets / ascent-unit remembers); §5 the
  `ℤ₂`-successor homeomorphism (`odo_homeomorphism`); §6 the carry = leading run
  = floor distance (`carry_profile`).
- **`Theory/Raw/OdometerValue`** (16 PURE) — the profinite value `bval`:
  `bval_odo` proves `odo = (+1 mod 2ᵏ)` carry-explicitly, and **`odo_free`** the
  full `ℤ`-action freeness (`odoʲ f = f → j = 0`; `ℤ₂` torsion-free).
- **`Real213/ZeckendorfCarry`** (7 PURE) — the golden/Fibonacci-base carry
  `011 → 100` = the Fibonacci recurrence, value-preserving (`golden_adic_carry`);
  admissibility = Cassini.  Ostrowski(φ), the residue's own variable base.

### 2. νF population — two new cross-arc sections in `Theory/Raw/CoResidue` (94→108 PURE)
- §18: the lone Raw automorphism `coSwap` acts **freely** on the bit-stream
  escapes (`coSwap_boolSpine_free_action`).
- §19: the escapes carry the **shift dynamical system** (`boolSpine_shift_dynamics`);
  self-similarity = shift-periodicity, `spineL` the period-1 point.

### 3. C-phys consolidation bridges (DRLT falsifier surface)
- **C3** `Lens/Number/SharedUnitAcrossReadings.unit_bridges_dynamics_and_readings`
  — the unit `1` byte-identical across ascent/descent/glue/det.
- **C6** `Lib/Physics/Foundations/FalsifierRosterForced.falsifier_roster_forced`
  — the falsifier integers as forced polynomials in the unique `(NS,NT,d)`.
- **C7** `KoideFormula.koide_atoms_are_det_atoms` — Koide's `2/3` atoms ARE the
  determinant atoms.  (C1 closed-as-non-bridge per the "different 3" discipline.)

### 4. Narrative — 4 foundations essays + φ chapter
- New: `theory/essays/foundations/{the_frontier_has_a_form, the_residue_unit_odometer, the_unit}.md`
  (G182 promoted; the residue triptych + the unit-as-value synthesis).
- `theory/math/algebra/phi_self_similarity.md` §3.6 (frozen=dynamic φ) + §3.7
  (golden adic).  Essays now **46**.

### 5. Process + org-audit + merge
- Frontier board pruned: G178/G181 closed & archived; G189–G193 (Markov frontier)
  relocated to `frontiers/markov_lagrange/`; promotion ledger updated.
- `Theory/Raw/INDEX` rewritten (was stale: phantom Hom/Signed, omitted the
  residue-extension layer) → accurate 20 modules.
- Merged into main (4 markdown conflicts resolved: log unioned, INDEX counts,
  frontiers closure-records, HANDOFF); merged tree builds clean, all PURE.

## Current Precision Results (0 free parameters)
Unchanged this session — this was **math-frontier + foundations** work (the
residue unit's dynamics), not a physics-constant edit.  Canonical table:
`catalogs/physics-constants.md`.  The new physics-adjacent result is the
falsifier-roster forcing (`falsifier_roster_forced`, PURE) — the integers
`{5,3,22,6,10,192,12}` and Koide `2/3` as forced polynomials in `(NS,NT,d)=(3,2,5)`.

## Open Problems (Priority Order)

### 1. Markov uniqueness — the kernel `H` (TERMINAL localization, on main)
The `markov-uniqueness` branch (merged) has **maximally localized `H`** to one
irreducible instruction-residue — the uniform cross-word continuant-trace
`SEPARATE` (`G197`).  Everything around it is ∅-axiom; finite instances are
`decide`-verified (`MarkovUniquenessRaw`/`ContinuantMarkov`,
`markovNum_injective_pathsUpTo_4`).  **Pointing at the uniform residue IS Frobenius
(1913) — not a bounded step**, so this is honestly *not a tractable next theorem*;
the productive directions are the other open frontiers.  Frontier notes:
`research-notes/frontiers/markov_lagrange/{G194…G199}.md` (`G197` = the terminal finding).

### 2. Pure-`Nat` toolkit + left-cancellation dedup — DONE
`lt_two_pow` and the canonical `add_left_cancel` live in `Meta/Nat/PureNat`; the
three former duplicate proofs (`Beq213.nat_add_left_cancel_pure`,
`NatHelper.add_left_cancel_pure`, `GoldenFormMarkov.add_left_cancel_pure`) now
delegate to it as one-line wrappers (signatures preserved, consumers unchanged).
One proof, three re-exports; all PURE.

### 3. Odometer `ℤ`-action ↔ Markov / Stern-Brocot (`SL(2,ℤ)`) — first bridge DONE
`Real213/OdometerSternBrocotUnit.odometer_sternbrocot_shared_unit` (2 PURE): the dyadic odometer
and the Stern-Brocot mediant tree are both `List Bool`-path-indexed residue descents sharing the
unimodular unit (`det genL = NS−NT = 1`, `genL = P`).  Honest scope: shared *value* + *index*, not
the (residual) dyadic↔CF Minkowski-`?` conjugacy.  **Next on this arc**: build `?` as a
residue-internal order-isomorphism of the two `List Bool` trees (harder).  Frontier note:
`research-notes/frontiers/odometer_unit_synthesis.md`.

### 4. (carried) Other open frontiers
π non-holonomicity (`frontiers/pi_nonholonomicity/`), spiral-axis
(`frontiers/spiral_axis/` G169/G171/G185), completability, sequence-depth, the
p-adic direction H (`frontiers/G124_padic_drlt_5adic`), geometrization knots
(`frontiers/G121_dim4_self_pointing_axis`), Eisenstein (`frontiers/G167_…`).
See `research-notes/frontiers/INDEX.md`.

## Unresolved from This Session
- Carry-depth as a *fully decidable* real-classification coordinate is
  constructively obstructed (`¬∀ ↔ ∃` = `object1_not_surjective` at the
  bit-stream scale) — recorded as an honest ceiling in the odometer essay, not a
  gap.  A decidable *sub-class* (eventually-periodic streams) may be reachable.
- `tools/sync_namespaces.py`: 116 pre-existing namespace/path mismatches
  repo-wide (not from this branch) — a standing cleanup, deferred.

## Next
Either (a) the Minkowski-`?` dyadic↔CF conjugacy as a residue-internal order-iso
(Open Problem 3 continuation), or (b) resume the Markov `H` kernel via the
continuant program (`Real213/Continuant.lean`, Open Problem 1).  (Open Problems 2
and the first odometer↔Stern-Brocot bridge are done.)

## Three-tier state (per `CLAUDE.md` "Three-tier discipline")
- **Promotions this session**: `the_frontier_has_a_form` (G182 → essay),
  `the_residue_unit_odometer` + `the_unit` (new essays), `phi_self_similarity`
  §3.6/§3.7 (frozen=dynamic φ + golden adic); G178/G181 archived.  Ledger:
  `research-notes/promotion_essay_log.md`.
- **Promotion candidates**: PURE-closed sub-trees lacking `theory/` chapters —
  see `theory/PROMOTION_CRITERIA.md`.
- **Active scratchpad**: `research-notes/frontiers/` (open board; markov_lagrange,
  pi_nonholonomicity, spiral_axis, …).  Top-level = anchors only.  Sink rule
  holds (0 permanent-tier citations of research-notes files).
