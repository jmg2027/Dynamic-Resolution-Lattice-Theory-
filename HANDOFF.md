# Session Handoff — 2026-06-24 (autonomous research: Nat213 order discipline)

## Branch
`claude/continuation-5yvjwq` — working tree clean, pushed. **Full `lake build
E213` passes clean (461/461).** All new theorems ∅-axiom (`#print axioms`
empty, verified individually). Started from `main` after the previous
grounded-FTA + Leg-1 marathon merged.

## What Was Done This Session (autonomous-research, four iterations)

Four focused iterations on the **descent-leg discipline** over `Nat213` (the
Raw-generated ℕ₊, `Lens/Number/Nat213/`) — completing the native order
(strict + non-strict total orders), then extracting the **gcd** and
**coprimality** disciplines, plus dedup and INDEX refresh.

### Iteration 4: coprimality `Coprime.lean` (PURE ✓) — NEW FILE
Built on `Gcd`: `Coprime a b := IsGcd a b one` (gcd is the divisibility bottom).
- **`coprime_dvd_mul`** (headline) — `gcd(a,b)=1` and `a ∣ b·c ⟹ a ∣ c`, the
  `EuclidUnique.euclid` scaling trick packaged generically from
  `Gcd.isGcd_mul_left` (scale `gcd(b,a)=1` by `c` → `gcd(c·b,c·a)=c`).
- **`coprime_mul`/`mul_coprime`** — multiplicative closure: coprime to each factor
  ⟹ coprime to the product (a common divisor of `a` and `b·c` is coprime to `b`,
  so divides `c`, and being coprime to `c` divides `one`).
- `coprime_comm`, `coprime_one_{left,right}`, `coprime_self_imp` (only the unit is
  self-coprime), `coprime_of_dvd_{left,right}` (descent to divisors).
- Wired into the aggregator (now 461 modules).

### Iteration 3: the gcd discipline `Gcd.lean` (PURE ✓) — NEW FILE
`EuclidUnique.gcd_exists_mul` had proved subtractive-gcd existence with the
*scaled* multiplicative spec in one well-founded induction (no zero, no
subtraction operator). Extracted the clean discipline:
- **`IsGcd a b d`** — the greatest lower bound of `a`, `b` in the `Dvd` partial
  order. **`isGcd_exists`** (from the algorithm), **`isGcd_unique`** (via
  `dvd_antisymm` — "the" gcd justified), `isGcd_comm`, projections, `isGcd_self`,
  `isGcd_one_{left,right}`, `isGcd_of_dvd`.
- **`isGcd_mul_left`/`isGcd_mul_right`** — the multiplicative law
  `gcd(c·a,c·b)=c·gcd(a,b)` (Euclid's Bézout substitute), from scaled existence +
  uniqueness.
- **`gcd_meet_semilattice`** — capstone: divisibility over `Nat213` is a
  meet-semilattice. Wired into the aggregator (now 460 modules).

### Iteration 2: the non-strict order `le` + cross-discipline bridge (PURE ✓)
- **`Nat213.Order.le`** — promoted the non-strict order from a buried local
  helper in `Factorization.lean` (which had only `le_refl`/`le_succ_of_le`) to a
  full **total partial order**: `le_refl`, `le_of_lt`, `le_succ_of_le`,
  `le_trans`, `le_antisymm`, `le_total`, and the `le_total_order` capstone (the
  non-strict twin of `lt_strict_total_order`). Also promoted `lt_succ_self` and
  `lt_of_succ_lt_succ`. `Factorization` now keeps only the *decidability*
  (`decLt`, `decBoundedExists`) and reuses Order's primitives; `EuclidUnique`'s
  `lt_trans` redirected from Factorization to Order.
- **`Divisibility.dvd_imp_le`** — `a ∣ t → a ≤ t` (divisibility refines the
  additive order), one line via `dvd_imp_eq_or_lt` read through `Order.le`. The
  bridge between the multiplicative (`Dvd`) and additive (`le`) disciplines.

### Iteration 1: the strict order completed + INDEX refresh (PURE ✓)
A focused iteration tightening the native order and fixing badly-stale docs.

### 1. `Nat213.Order`: completed the native strict order (PURE ✓)
`Order.lean` proved trichotomy, multiplicative monotonicity, and cancellation
but was missing transitivity, asymmetry, and additive monotonicity.
- **`lt_trans`** — *promoted* from a `private lt_trans'` that lived inside
  `Divisibility.lean` (a dedup smell, repo org rules 7/8). Now public in
  `Order`; `Divisibility` reuses it and its private duplicate is gone.
- **`lt_asymm`** — `a < b → ¬ b < a` (trans + irrefl).
- **`lt_strict_total_order`** — capstone bundling irrefl + trans + trichotomy
  (the additive twin of `Divisibility.divisibility_preorder_with_bottom`).
- **`lt_add_right`** (`a < a + b`), **`add_lt_add_left`**, **`add_lt_add_right`**
  — additive monotonicity, from `add_assoc`/`add_comm` only. The additive
  counterpart of the multiplicative `lt_mul_left`/`lt_mul_self` already present.
All over `Nat213` — no `toNat`, no Lean `Nat` order lemma.

### 2. `Nat213/INDEX.md` refresh (doc hygiene)
The INDEX was stale at "Files (12) / five representations" while the directory
had grown to **25 + Tower/5**. The entire leg-2 number-theory discipline
(Order, Divisibility, Irreducible, EuclidUnique, Prime, Factorization, FTA,
Infinitude, ChebyshevLower), the generation layer (Generation, Forcing), the
multiplicative system (MultSystem, MultSystemValue, SignatureMaps), and the two
new Tower completion files were unlisted. Reorganised by role with accurate
one-line descriptions and a current count.

## Current Precision Results (0 free parameters)
**No physics touched this session** (pure math/order-theory + docs). The DRLT
precision table is unchanged — see `catalogs/physics-constants.md` (canonical).

## Open Problems (Priority Order)
Unchanged from the prior handoff — the deep items are conceptual residue:

### 1. Leg 3 residue — "suffices by breadth, not proven unique"
Four rival primitive classes are formally excluded, but no proof that *no*
conceivable primitive generates equal richness. Deepest open item, likely not
fully closable. `frontiers/the_descent_leg.md` (Leg-3) + `frontiers/the_one_act.md`.

### 2. Leg 1 final residue — the kernel `inductive` itself
`Nat213`/`RawNat` still borrow the kernel's `inductive` to *have* `Raw`, and
`Nat` as the `depth` readout (conceded). `frontiers/the_descent_leg.md` §5.

### 3. Further leg-2 disciplines over `Nat213`
The order cone is **complete** (strict `lt` + non-strict `le`, both total orders;
additive + multiplicative monotonicity; Dvd↔le bridge), the **gcd** discipline is
extracted (`Gcd.lean`: meet-semilattice), and **coprimality** is done
(`Coprime.lean`: Euclid's coprime-division law + descent + multiplicative
closure). Remaining natural deposits, all low-risk:
- a **well-ordering / strong-induction principle** on `Nat213` packaged as a
  reusable lemma from `Factorization.wf_lt` (currently used ad hoc inside
  `gcd_exists_mul` etc.) — exposing `Nat213`'s well-foundedness as a named API.
- **`coprime_pow`** / `Coprime a b → Coprime (a^n) (b^m)` once a `pow` exists on
  `Nat213` (check whether Peano has it first).
- an `lcm` as the dual join (harder — needs a bound; defer).

## Next
Continue the descent-leg discipline build-out over `Nat213` (Open Problem 3 —
the well-ordering API is teed up) or open a fresh campaign regrounding another
field on `subMod`/structural descent (the prior handoff's thick target). The
deep conceptual residue (Open Problems 1–2) needs a specific new rival model and
is research-grade.

## Three-tier state
- No promotions this session (incremental theorem deposits + doc fix; the
  Nat213 cone is already promoted at `theory/math/numbersystems/naturals_from_the_spine.md`).
- **Active scratchpad**: `research-notes/frontiers/the_descent_leg.md` (Leg-1/Leg-3 residue).
