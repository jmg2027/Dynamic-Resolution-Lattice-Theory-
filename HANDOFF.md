# Session Handoff — 2026-06-16

## Branch
`claude/multi-agent-math-research-n68ovi` — all pushed; **already merged to
`main`** (fast-forward) at the marathon close-out, then continued. Full Math
builds clean (`lake build E213.Lib.Math` → 1936 modules).

## Scope
Math-only marathon (physics excluded by standing directive — it follows once
the math is complete). Multi-agent: parallel general-purpose subagents on deep
∅-axiom targets, each verified PURE in isolated scratch, ported into the corpus.

## Forcing-PURE leg (current — "forcing vs bookkeeping" selector)

Per the originator's reframe ("본질적으로 뭘까" → collect theorems where requiring
∅-axiom *forces a structurally different, revealing proof*, not bookkeeping):
running collection `research-notes/frontiers/pure_forces_different_proof.md`;
permanent chapter `theory/meta/forcing_versus_bookkeeping.md`. New this leg:

> **Session running total: ~41 ∅-axiom modules + the `exists_collision` primitive
> (now reused in 5 distinct theorems: DividesPair, TwoSquare, ErdosSzekeres,
> Pisano, ConsecutiveSumDvd), all PURE, full Math green at 1995.** Two complete classical arcs closed
> end-to-end: **Euler's theorem** (`EulerTheorem`) and the **Fermat–Gauss
> two-square characterization** (`TwoSquareTheorem` + `SumTwoSquaresCharacterization`
> + `InertPrimeThreeMod4` + `SumTwoSquaresOddPower` + `SumTwoSquaresBiconditional`,
> `isSumTwoSqNat_iff_even_vp`). Comprehensive constructive-analysis ledger
> (force-the-modulus: EVT/UniformLimit/Banach/Riemann/Cesaro/ModulusConvergence/
> LimitArithmetic/SqueezeProduct/**AlternatingSeries**; calibrations: BW→LPO,
> HeineCantor→fan, Dini→fan, real-decision quartet sign/equality/apartness/
> comparability ↔ LLPO/WLPO/MP). Units thread capped by **`WilsonGeneralization`**
> (29 PURE, `units_prod_eq_selfinv_prod` — Wilson's ±1 as the inverse-involution
> fixed-point product). Fresh recurrence thread: **`PisanoPeriod`**
> (Fibonacci mod m periodic, period = computed collision gap, backward via ℤ/m
> cancellation). **`ConsecutiveSumDvd`** (a consecutive run sums ≡0 mod n,
> computed). Fibonacci-mod-m sub-arc complete (PisanoPeriod + PisanoPeriodMinimal + FibonacciApparition: rank of apparition, zeros = its multiples). FTA complete (PrimeFactorization existence + FTAUniqueness: multiplicity = vp q n). Inequality sub-arc: Cauchy–Schwarz + Chebyshev (computed slack). Cauchy–Schwarz via Lagrange (slack = computed cross-square sum). Recent combinatorics: Redei (tournament Ham path), Mirsky (poset antichain cover via computed height), ConsecutiveSumDvd; analysis: AlternatingSeries, ComparisonTest, LimitArithmetic, SqueezeProduct. Open frontiers: `hall_general_induction`, `wilson_pm1_classification`,
> `analysis_modulus_pending` (product/squeeze done; abstract additive-metric only).
- **`NumberTheory/UnitsOfZn`** (12 PURE, vein A) — `(ℤ/n)^×` on representatives:
  unit = coprime residue, closure = gcd fact, inverses = Bezout, order = φ(n)
  (`unit_count_eq_totient := rfl`). Quotient ring was packaging.
- **`NumberTheory/DividesPairPigeonhole`** (7 PURE, vein B) — n+1 in [1,2n] ⟹
  one divides another; dividing pair computed from v2 comparison.
- **`Combinatorics/Pigeonhole.exists_collision` / `exists_collision_lt`** (PURE)
  — NEW reusable primitive: constructive collision-*producing* pigeonhole
  (returns the pair via decidable `scan` + `shiftAround`), where `no_inj_lt`
  only refuted injectivity. The witness-returning form is pigeonhole's
  constructive content.
- **`NumberTheory/TwoSquareTheorem`** (19 PURE, vein B capstone) — Fermat's
  two-square theorem, hard direction (`p ≡ 1 mod 4 ⟹ p = a²+b²`), FULL incl.
  descent to `a²+b² = p`. All non-constructive content localized to
  `exists_collision_lt` (the Thue box collision). Reuses `QRNegOne`, `IntSqrt`,
  `PolyRoot` Nat↔Int bridges, `Int213`.
- **`NumberTheory/FermatQuartic`** (29 PURE, vein B capstone) — `x⁴+y⁴≠z²` (and
  `≠z⁴`), FULL descent. Classical minimal-counterexample → explicit `strongRecOn`
  on `z` whose step *constructs* the smaller solution (two Pythagorean-converse
  inversions + coprime-square split returning `a=√r,b=√s,c=√(r²+s²)`). Built the
  missing `pyth_converse` (Pythagorean converse over Nat). Nat-native.
- **`NumberTheory/PrimesThreeModFour`** (14 PURE, vein B) — infinitely many
  primes ≡3 mod 4, `∀ N, ∃ p, N<p ∧ prime p ∧ p%4=3`. Computed Euclid witness
  (least ≡3-mod-4 prime factor of `4·N!−1`); keystone `exists_prime_factor_3mod4`
  by least-factor recursion. No finite-list contradiction.
- **`Combinatorics/ErdosSzekeres`** (29 PURE, vein B, FRESH domain) — monotone
  subsequence via the `(inc,dec)` label-box `exists_collision_lt`; explicit
  subsequence extracted choice-free (`inc_subseq`). Third `exists_collision`
  reuse — broadens beyond number theory.
- **`NumberTheory/TotientMultiplicative`** (20 PURE, vein A) — `totient_mul`:
  φ(mn)=φ(m)φ(n) coprime, via the explicit CRT counting bijection. **Closes the
  leg's own loop**: built on `UnitsOfZn` + `CRTReconstruction` (this leg). CRT
  iso = reconstruction algorithm; φ-mult = Fubini reindex of the coprimality
  indicator. (Recovered from a watchdog-stalled agent — core was complete in
  scratch.)

Meta-finding crystallized in the chapter: **a primitive can be a
non-constructivity sink** — `exists_collision` localizes the sole non-constructive
step of THREE classical theorems (DividesPair, TwoSquare, ErdosSzekeres); the
named primitive, not the individual theorems, is the deliverable.

Honest rejection: √2/√p irrationality by v2-parity — the bare impossibility is
already PURE in `Irrational/SqrtPure` (via descent); a reproof is a duplicate
result, not a forcing case.

### Analysis sub-arc (answering "do the things that look impossible ∅-axiom")
On the directive to tackle continuity/limits/analysis — the domains classically
tied to LEM/compactness/choice. Answered symmetrically (vein C), four cases:
- **`Analysis/ExtremeValue`** (23 PURE) — EVT modulus form: sup VALUE computable
  (`CauchyCutSeq.limit` + convergence modulus), located/approached, attained at
  every finite resolution, but the maximizer `max_reached_by_none` (the argmax
  moves with resolution — analysis-level `object1_not_surjective`). Unconditional.
- **`Analysis/UniformLimitContinuous`** (20 PURE) — uniform limit of continuous is
  continuous: the limit's modulus *computed* `Ω m = ω_{r(m+2)}(m+2)`. Unconditional.
- **`Logic/BolzanoWeierstrass`** (13 PURE) — binary BW *calibrated*: `lpo_of_bw`
  (BW ⟹ LPO); `bw_of_lpo` at plain LPO NOT provable (extraction is Π⁰₂, above the
  ledger). The import named (LPO) and measured (Π⁰₂), not removed.
- **`Logic/HeineCantor`** (10 PURE) — HC *calibrated* to the fan theorem:
  `heineCantor_of_fan`, the fan theorem the load-bearing `Bar → Bounded` bridge.
- **`Logic/Dini`** (14 PURE) — Dini's theorem *calibrated* to the fan theorem
  (sibling of HeineCantor); monotonicity turns the per-interval bound into a
  uniform convergence index. `dini_of_fan`.
- **`Logic/RealDichotomyLLPO`** (31 PURE) — the **analytic-LLPO** calibration,
  two-sided: the real sign-dichotomy `∀ x, x≤0 ∨ 0≤x` IS LLPO
  (`llpo_of_realDichotomy` + converse). Locates exactly why the *exact* IVT /
  bisection sign step can't be ∅-axiom (it's LLPO) while the corpus's *approximate*
  IVT (`cutEq … 0`) stays pure. The encoding's "denominator blow-up" is the
  omniscience cost made visible. The deepest analysis calibration.
- **`Analysis/BanachFixedPoint`** (12 PURE) — Banach contraction fixed-point,
  modulus form: Picard iterates Cauchy with computed geometric modulus `N(m)=m`
  (`picard_cauchy`); fixed point the Cauchy limit, located + unique. Completeness
  as data+spec (`CompleteMetricModulus`), not an existence miracle. Reuses this
  session's own `MetricModulus`. Unconditional.
- **`Logic/RealEqualityWLPO`** (16 PURE) + **`Logic/RealApartnessMP`** (15 PURE) —
  the **real-decision triad** with `RealDichotomyLLPO`: sign ⟺ LLPO, equality ⟺
  WLPO, apartness ⟺ MP (mirrors `lpo_iff_wlpo_and_mp` at the real level). The
  negation is free; the disjunctive verdict is LLPO/WLPO; locating the apartness
  witness is MP (a bounded search the located bound makes terminate). Both
  two-sided.

The symmetry (now NINE analysis cases): **EVT + UniformLimit + Banach force the
hidden modulus; BW + HeineCantor + Dini + the real-decision triad
(RealDichotomyLLPO/RealEqualityWLPO/RealApartnessMP) name and measure the import**
— a reverse-math ledger across the LPO / WLPO / MP / LLPO / fan rungs. 213 never
smuggles an exterior. Logged in the frontier collection + the methodology
chapter's vein-C section. Full Math green at **1972 modules**.

### Tier-C continuation (autonomous marathon, post-triad)
- **`Analysis/RiemannContinuous`** (9 PURE) — continuous ⟹ Riemann integrable,
  convergence modulus *computed* from the u.c. modulus (`riemannSum_cauchy`);
  integral = explicit Cauchy limit. Reuses `MetricModulus` + `CutRiemann`.
- **`Combinatorics/HallMarriage`** (36 PURE) — Hall's matching produced as DATA
  (scan returns the right vertex; Hall = the scan never fails). Closed: framework
  + counting infra + computed `hall_matching_{zero,one,two}`. General-`n`
  (Halmos–Vaughan) is OPEN → `frontiers/hall_general_induction.md`; an agent is
  currently attempting it (scratch `ScratchHG`). Full Math green at **1974**.
- **`Analysis/ModulusConvergence`** (6 PURE) — limit theory on `MetricModulus`:
  `limit_unique` (located-unique limit, ∀m close m L L'), `conv_imp_cauchy`
  (Cauchy modulus computed from convergence modulus), `subseq_converges`,
  `const_converges`. Done directly (not via agent).
- **`Analysis/CesaroMean`** (16 PURE) — Cesàro convergence, averaging modulus
  computed `Nstep m = N + 2^m·E + 1` (`E` = early-term spread); `closeAvg` is the
  multiplied-out `Nat` inequality (no division). Pure-twin `NatHelper.add_mul`.
- **`Logic/RealComparabilityLLPO`** (2 PURE) — general real comparability
  `∀ x y, x≤y ∨ y≤x ⟹ LLPO` (reals not constructively totally ordered); one-liner
  over `RealDichotomyLLPO`.
- **`Analysis/LimitArithmetic`** (12 PURE) — sum limit law on `distMet`:
  `distN_add_le` + `add_converges` (modulus `max(ra(m+1),rb(m+1))`) + `shift`.
- **`Analysis/SqueezeProduct`** (8 PURE) — `squeeze_converges` (a≤c≤b, a,b→L ⟹
  c→L) + `mul_converges_bounded` (product, modulus shifted by bit-length
  `floorLog 2 K + 1`). The limit-law thread (sum/product/squeeze/Cesàro/
  uniqueness/Cauchy) is now comprehensive.
- **Two-square arc COMPLETE** (∅-axiom, all computed modular facts, no ℤ[i]):
  `TwoSquareTheorem` (hard dir) + `SumTwoSquaresCharacterization` (18 PURE, the
  "if" direction via the Brahmagupta product) + `InertPrimeThreeMod4` (7 PURE,
  the "only if" core) + `SumTwoSquaresOddPower` (15 PURE, `even_vp_three_mod4`:
  a sum of two squares has even q-adic valuation at every q≡3mod4 — the inert-prime
  descent on `vp`). **Characterization CLOSED both directions**
  (`frontiers/two_square_only_if.md` → closed). Full Math green at **1982**.

**Orchestration lesson (for next iteration):** the env cleans agent scratch dirs
between Bash calls, which RACES any "scratch removed ⟹ done" watcher and gives
false "no checkpoint" reads (Cesàro + LimitArithmetic both *succeeded* but read as
misses first). Reliable signal = the agent's own completion notification (it
carries the report + checkpoint path); re-check `/tmp/<tag>/Result.lean` after the
notification, not on scratch-dir poll.

### Open frontiers (next-iteration targets — recorded per PROCESS frontier rule)
- `frontiers/hall_general_induction.md` — Hall general-`n` (Halmos–Vaughan);
  framework + n≤2 closed in `Combinatorics/HallMarriage`; remaining = `Fin`
  subgraph re-indexing after vertex+neighbor deletion. (An agent attempt left no
  PURE checkpoint — the reindexing is the genuine hard part.)
- `frontiers/analysis_modulus_pending.md` — Cesàro mean, limit-arithmetic
  (sum/product need an *additive* metric beyond `MetricModulus`), squeeze. Do
  **directly**, not via one-shot agent — the obstruction is pure-`Nat`-inequality
  propext-avoidance, handled interactively with `NatHelper`/`PureNat` twins (as
  `ModulusConvergence` just demonstrated).
- Other unselected: fan ⟺ WKL relationship; exact-IVT⟺LLPO (the function-family
  version, beyond the dichotomy); EGZ / Dilworth / Mirsky (combinatorics).

Full `E213.Lib.Math` green at **1967 modules**; all pushed. Leg total: **11
modules + the `exists_collision` primitive**, ∅-axiom PURE — 7 number-theory/
combinatorics (12+7+19+29+14+29+20) + 4 analysis (23+20+13+10).

## Post-merge continuation (after merge-to-main; second marathon leg)
Elementary classical number theory + combinatorics, all ∅-axiom PURE:
- **Euler's theorem** `EulerTheorem.euler_theorem`: `a^φ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n)`, all
  n≥2, coprime a (39 PURE) — Route B (totative-product permutation + unit
  cancellation; Route A rejected as circular for composite n). HEADLINE.
- **Multiplicative order** `MultiplicativeOrder.{ord, ord_dvd_of_pow_one,
  ord_dvd_totient}`: ord divides φ(n) for COMPOSITE n (26 PURE) — generalizes
  the corpus's prime-only MulOrder, Euler-enabled.
- **Multiplicative-function structure** (the family-level theorems):
  `SummatoryMultiplicative.summatory_mul` (f mult ⟹ Σ_{d∣n}f(d) mult),
  `DirichletMultiplicative.dconv_mul` (f,g mult ⟹ f∗g mult — Dirichlet-ring
  capstone), `MultiplicativeUniqueness.mult_eq_of_prime_pow` (determined by
  prime-power values), `SquareValuation.isSquare_iff_all_vp_even` (general
  square char, frontier crux #2 all-primes), `LiouvilleValuation.lambdaV_*`
  (completely-multiplicative λV, general divisor-sum=[square]).
- **Totient pairing** `TotientPairing.{totient_even (φ(n) even, n≥3),
  sum_totatives (2Σ=nφ), gcd_reflect}` (18 PURE).
- **Combinatorics** `BinomialInversion.{binomial_orthogonality,
  binomial_inversion}` (39 PURE), `SurjectionCount.{surj_zero_of_lt,
  surj_diag}` + a fresh finite-difference machinery (`A_rec`, `PolyLe`
  degree theory) (44 PURE).
The multiplicative_divisor_theory.md chapter was updated (§2.5 structural
theorems, §3/§7 generalizations).
- **Valuation arc**: `LegendreDePolignac` (Legendre recurrence + de Polignac
  digit-sum `(p−1)·vp_p(n!)+s_p(n)=n`, 15 PURE) → `KummerTheorem`
  (`(p−1)·vp_p(C(m+n,m)) = s_p(m)+s_p(n)−s_p(m+n)` = base-p carry count, 7 PURE).
- **Set-partition combinatorics cluster** (promoted to
  `theory/math/combinatorics/inclusion_exclusion_set_partitions.md`):
  `BinomialInversion` (39), `SurjectionCount` (44, + a fresh finite-difference
  machinery `A_rec`/`PolyLe`), `DerangementInclusionExclusion` (11),
  `StirlingExplicit` (`surj=n!·S`, 13), `BellStirling` (`B_n=Σ_k S(n,k)` general
  + the block-conditioning identity, 10).
- **Order theory (new `Lib/Math/Order/` cluster — fresh domain pivot)**:
  `GaloisConnection` (unit/counit, monotonicity, triangle identities, the g∘f
  closure operator; multiply/divide adjunction witness, 15 PURE),
  `BooleanAlgebra` (Huntington axioms ⟹ complement uniqueness, double-complement,
  both De Morgan laws; Bool instance, 25 PURE), `KnasterTarski` (lfp/gfp
  fixed-point theorem on a parametrized complete lattice, 19 PURE).

## What Was Done This Session (first leg, before merge)

### A. Multiplicative divisor theory — closed ∅-axiom end-to-end (capstone)
The whole elementary multiplicative number-theory framework, all PURE
(`#print axioms → none`), promoted to `theory/math/numbertheory/multiplicative_divisor_theory.md`:
- **Dirichlet ring**: `DirichletConvolution` (comm+assoc) + `DirichletIdentities`
  (`μ∗1=ε`, `φ∗1=id`, `σ=id∗1`, ε the unit) — 9 PURE.
- **Euclid's perfect-number theorem** `PerfectNumbers.euclid_perfect` (general k) — 19 PURE.
- **τ-parity** `TauParity.tau_odd_iff_square` (τ(n) odd ⟺ n square), via a symmetric
  double-sum parity core (`doubleSum_parity`) — 22 PURE.
- **σ-parity COMPLETE** `SigmaParityComplete.sigma_odd_iff` (σ(n) odd ⟺ n square or
  twice-square) — 6 PURE. Closed across 4 files: `SigmaParity` (σ(p^k) parity, 13),
  `OddPartDecomposition` (2-adic split, 20), `SquareCharacterization`
  (`coprime_isSquare_mul` general/no-UFD + `sq_or_twice_iff`, 11), `SigmaParityComplete`
  (smallest-prime-power strong induction). Recovered `SquareCharacterization` by hand
  after the SQSP agent stalled (fixed `rw` over-rewrite bugs, wrote the §3 bridges).

### B. Recurrence sequences / classical identities (all PURE)
- `LucasSequences` (44) — parametric `U_n(P,Q)`, `V_n(P,Q)`: quadratic relation
  `V²−DU²=4Qⁿ`, even+odd index doubling, `U_n∣U_{2n}`.
- `ContinuedFractionConvergents` (23) — `p(n+1)q(n)−p(n)q(n+1)=(−1)ⁿ` + coprimality.
- `FermatNumbers` (23) — telescoping product + Goldbach pairwise coprimality.
- `SylvesterSequence` (22) — telescoping + pairwise coprimality.
- `VajdaIdentity` (4) — the 2-parameter Fibonacci unifier (Cassini/Catalan/d'Ocagne).
- `Combinatorics/MultinomialTheorem` (11), `Combinatorics/PentagonalNumbers` (13),
  `Combinatorics/Josephus` (20, closed-form `J(2^m+L)=2L+1`),
  `SymmetricPolyIdentities` +Newton 4-var, `FibZSums` (5, low-novelty toolkit port).

### C. Inequalities cluster (SOS over Int, all PURE)
`Foundations/{SchurInequality (3), NesbittInequality (2), NewtonInequalities (5),
MuirheadInequality (1)}` — each via an explicit `ring_intZ` SOS identity + nonneg
regrouping. Complete the AM-GM/majorization picture with the existing `SumCubesAMGM`.

### D. Marathon close-out (this session's second half)
Merge main → `/process` (16 sink-rule decouplings) → promotion (divisor framework
chapter + 3 frontiers archived) → cross-domain note → `/essay`
(`multiplicativity_is_the_x_count_lens`) → `/org-audit` (narrative hygiene) →
`/purity-check` (276 PURE / 0 dirty) → `/ready-to-merge` (READY) → this handoff.

## Precision results (physics)
Unchanged this session (physics out of scope). The merged-in physics state lives
in `catalogs/physics-constants.md` + `STRICT_ZERO_AXIOM.md`; main's recent work
(CP δ octet, gravity Gram = metric⊕symplectic, Basel-depth "dynamic resolution",
forced/read split) is summarized in `theory/STATE.md`.

## Open Problems (priority order)
### 1. Multiplicative-function descent abstraction
`SigmaParityComplete.sigma_odd_square_odd` forces a multiplicative function's value
by smallest-prime-power descent, but this isn't abstracted into a general "any
multiplicative function descends over the UFD vector" schema. Is it a distinct
descent rung or the UFD rung read through the counting Lens?
Frontier: `research-notes/frontiers/crossdomain_divisor_x_branch_merge.md` (§1).

### 2. Involution-parity shared lemma (cross-domain test)
Test whether `TauParity.doubleSum_parity` (Z/2 involution parity = fixed-point count
mod 2) and the cohomology constant-mode count (`bcount_const`/`im_count_inj_complement`)
instantiate one shared 213-native involution lemma, or are merely analogous.
Frontier: `research-notes/frontiers/crossdomain_divisor_x_branch_merge.md` (§2).

### 3. (carried) Open frontiers from main
57 live notes in `research-notes/frontiers/` — Markov uniqueness, π non-holonomicity,
c=2 forcing residue, Ricci-flow smooth core, etc. See `research-notes/frontiers/INDEX.md`.

## Unresolved from This Session
- The SQSP agent stalled without checkpointing (left a broken scratch with `rw`
  over-rewrite bugs); recovered by hand. Lesson reinforced: subagents on hard proofs
  must `/tmp`-checkpoint frequently (now in the dispatch prompts).
- Saturation rising in elementary number theory / combinatorics — several probes
  this session returned near-duplicates (e.g. `FibZSums` mirrors the Nat-`fib`
  `FibonacciSums`); honestly flagged. Favor framework-extension over fact-hunting.

## Next
- Merge this branch to main (final marathon step).
- Then: the multiplicative-function-descent abstraction (Open Problem #1) is the
  crispest next math target — it would add a rung to the descent schema
  (`universal_descent_schema`) and unify the σ-parity induction with GCD/UFD/Markov/Ricci.

## Three-tier state
- **Promotions this session**: `theory/math/numbertheory/multiplicative_divisor_theory.md`
  ← (closed frontiers gauss_totient_general / mobius_divisor_sum_general /
  sigma_parity_general, archived to `research-notes/archive/numbertheory/`).
  Essay: `theory/essays/synthesis/multiplicativity_is_the_x_count_lens.md`.
- **Promotion candidates**: the standalone PURE sub-trees (Lucas / Fermat / Sylvester /
  continued-fraction / Josephus / inequalities) are tier-2 closed but don't yet warrant
  individual theory chapters (single-file topics); revisit if they grow.
- **Active scratchpad**: `research-notes/frontiers/` (57 live notes).
