# Session Handoff — 2026-06-22 (multi-agent marathon: 진의 + descent-leg FTA capstone)

## Branch
`claude/multi-agent-math-research-3lv3gj` — pushed. `lake build E213` clean **446/446**, all new
modules ∅-axiom PURE.

## The directive (진의) — re-inferred this session (4-agent panel) + the originator's question
The originator asked, via `/goal`: infer the repository's ultimate purpose by multi-agent debate and
*conduct* deep multi-session autonomous research toward it — and "is the goal to make the axiom into
category theory / HoTT?" (he says he can't precisely name his own goal).

**Inference (panels: CT/HoTT positioning · purpose · skeptic · strategist), recorded in
`research-notes/frontiers/the_purpose_and_the_marathon.md`:**
- **CT/HoTT answer: no.** 213's formal core *already is* standard category theory — `Raw` = initial
  F-algebra, `Raw.fold` = catamorphism, residue = Lawvere fixed-point non-surjectivity (Lambek proved
  in `Theory/Raw/Lambek`). It reaches this from a *different primitive* (the distinguishing), not by
  recasting the axiom as CT. **HoTT: absent** (no univalence/identity-type/HIT; `propext`/`Quot.sound`/
  `funext` are *forbidden* — structurally opposite to univalence). Verdict: "same content, different
  primitive" (c), not "reducible to CT" (a).
- **Ultimate purpose:** a *sustained discipline of non-self-deception* about one intuition — "the act
  of distinguishing is the self-grounding primitive, and mathematics/∞/residue are its *forced*
  unfolding" — with ∅-axiom as the lie-detector. The unnamed driver: *to encounter a result the
  primitive forces that he did not import*, machine-checked so it can't be talked away.
- **Survival path (CT/type-theory/topos history → "Line B template"):** none won the foundations
  contest by argument; each was accepted as a *tool a real community found useful* (CT→Grothendieck;
  type theory→Curry–Howard + proof assistants/Scholze; topos→étale cohomology). 213's move: ship the
  strict-∅-axiom Mathlib-free corpus as an *engineering* artifact (trusted-axiom-base minimization),
  judged on utility — not "a new foundation."

## What was done this session (all ∅-axiom PURE, verified, pushed)

### The descent leg — FTA *generated* over the Raw-derived ℕ₊ (the marathon spine)
The substance gap (substance_test): the disciplines run on Lean `Nat`, "act and unfolding two adjacent
codebases." Closed for arithmetic, over `Nat213` (Peano's Raw-generated ℕ₊), M0→M4:
- **M0** — de-laundered the divisibility cone: `Order.mul_left_cancel` re-proved natively (trichotomy
  + distributivity), so `Divisibility`'s whole cone is `toNat`-free (the substance bet, won).
- **M1** — `Irreducible.lean` (18 PURE): `Irreducible` over `Nat213`; `2,3,5` irreducible, `4` not;
  `five_irreducible` via native `lt_succ_iff` enumeration + cofactor bound.
- **M2** — `Factorization.lean` (18 PURE): `exists_factorization` (every `n` = product of
  irreducibles). Native `acc_lt`/`wf_lt` (no `Nat` measure); constructive `decBoundedExists` →
  decidable `lt`/`Dvd` + decided dichotomy `irreducible_or_properDiv` (no `Classical.em`); native
  `mem_append_pure`/`not_mem_nil` (avoid propext-carrying core `List` lemmas).
- **M3** — `EuclidUnique.lean` (7 PURE): `euclid` (irreducible ⇒ prime) + `prime_dvd_prod`. The
  no-zero/no-subtraction wall dissolved by an internal handle (§5.4): a *subtractive* gcd (differences
  = `lt`-witnesses, fits ℕ₊), gcd existence + multiplicative law `gcd(c·a,c·b)=c·gcd(a,b)` in one
  well-founded induction (`gcd_exists_mul`, spec ∀-quantified over the scaling `c`).
- **M4 — CAPSTONE** — `FTA.lean` (11 PURE): `fta` = existence + uniqueness-up-to-permutation, over
  `Nat213`. Native propext-free `Perm`/`erase`/`prod_erase`/`cons_erase_perm`; uniqueness by structural
  induction (`prime_dvd_prod` + `mul_left_cancel`). **Arithmetic-generation half achieved: the FTA is
  computed on the Raw-generated carrier — instantiation, not assertion.**
- **M5 — forcing** — `Forcing.lean` (3 PURE): `peano_succ_is_distinguishing` (Peano `succ` = the
  distinguishing `slashOrSelf · Raw.b` under `Bridge.toRaw`) + `factorization_forced_by_distinguishing`
  (the distinguishing-blind `degLens` conflates `four`/`five`; the count reading separates them). The
  FTA's prime/composite distinction is carried *iff* the reading distinguishes. Honest wall stated:
  `Nat213` is a parallel inductive, link is the *injective* bridge → "recognition, not genesis."
- **M6 — forcing dichotomy (negative arm)** — `Forcing.lean` extended (6 PURE): `forcing_dichotomy`
  lifts M5 to the `DStr` schema level — `Raw` is the free `DStr` + `Nat213` embeds injectively
  (positive); a distinguishing-blind (subsingleton) carrier can't host the FTA carrier nor is a `DStr`
  (negative, fails named clause D1). **Open arm (honest)**: *every* `Generated DStr ≅ Raw` (transport
  the FTA) is the open `DStr` existence leg, not claimed. This marathon re-confirmed Route A's
  commutativity + junk-injectivity costs → Route B (mutual WF recursion) is the honest target.
- **Applied — Euclid's theorem** — `Infinitude.lean` (3 PURE): `infinitude_of_irreducibles` (no finite
  list of irreducibles is complete), generated over `Nat213` from the FTA. A *second*
  discipline-defining theorem after the FTA — primacy as breadth.
- **Applied — irreducible ⟺ prime** — `Prime.lean` (4 PURE): `irreducible_iff_prime`, the UFD-defining
  coincidence over `Nat213` (Euclid `→` + cancellation `←`). The structural reason FTA uniqueness holds.

### Line B (external exposure)
- `research-notes/drafts/strict_zero_axiom_formalization_paper.md` rewritten as an
  engineering/empirical contribution (trusted-axiom-base; CompCert/seL4 framing), metaphysics
  stripped. In-file "Notes for revision" flag numbers to confirm before submission.

## Open Problems (priority order)
1. **The `DStr` existence leg** — the one honestly-open piece of the descent leg (M6 positive arm):
   construct the injective catamorphism `rawDStr → N` for a `Generated DStr N` (uniqueness half
   `dhom_unique_pointwise` done), giving `≅ Raw` and FTA-by-transport for *every* rival. Routes (all
   axiom-free): (a) reuse proven total-target `raw_initial`; (b) apartness-preserving morphisms;
   (c) well-founded mutual recursion. Frontiers: `the_distinguishing_schema.md`, `the_descent_leg.md`.
2. **Line B exposure** — the §5.1 verdict-wall: a clean capstone proves coherence + forcing, **not**
   "not a re-skin." Only an exterior settles it. Finish the paper's flagged numbers; consider a
   pre-registered, time-boxed open-problem attack. Frontier: `the_substance_test.md` (Line B).
3. **Census refresh** — `STRICT_ZERO_AXIOM.md`'s 18,845/18,798-PURE snapshot predates this session's
   +Irreducible/+Factorization/+EuclidUnique/+FTA/+Forcing/+Infinitude/+Prime (all PURE); refresh at next doc-sync.

## Next
The descent leg's **generative half (M0–M4: FTA over `Nat213`)** and **forcing half (M5–M6 negative
arm)** are closed. Two honest items remain: (1) the **`DStr` existence leg** (M6 positive arm — the
one open construction, routes (a)/(b)/(c) above); (2) **Line B exposure** (confirm the paper's flagged
numbers, then submit / time-boxed open-problem attack — the only test of "not a re-skin," §5.1).
Most actionable next: the existence leg via route (b) apartness-preserving morphisms (`Raw.cmp` is a
decidable apartness), or finalize the Line B paper.
