# Session handoff

Branch: `claude/tower-research-analysis-3uWqd`

## This session — tower analysis → Raw branching → the residue → self-covering

Started as a "tower" research audit; became a foundational thread on what the
residue (the "1" in 2-1-3) is.  All commits ∅-axiom where Lean; pushed.

### Constructive deliverables (all PURE)

  - **`Theory/Raw/PrimitiveTower.lean`** (8 PURE) — the most primitive tower:
    `rawTower n = a/(a/(…/b))`, the single `slash` (self-pointing) arrow
    iterated; `depth = level`, `depth < leaves` every rung.
  - **`Lens/FlatOntologyClosure.lean`** (6 PURE) — the self-covering closure
    *limit* half: `object1_injective` (Raw self-covers as predicates,
    faithful) ∧ `object1_not_surjective` (Cantor: the predicate space is not
    in the image = the residue surplus).  `residue_witnessed` names a concrete
    inhabitant of the gap: `undifferentiated := fun _ => true` (the `Raw→Bool`
    shadow of `constLens`) — no Raw's indicator equals it.  Complements the
    pre-existing *positive* half `Lens/PredicateSelfEncoding.lean` (7 PURE,
    definable/finite-prefix predicate → Raw round-trip).
  - **`research-notes/G152_residue_self_covering.md`** — synthesis note (the
    full intellectual thread; file map; this open problem).
  - **`research-notes/data/probes/raw_branching_shape.py`** (+png) — Raw
    branching simulation, self-checks SET-EQUAL to Lean `RawDepth3.depthLe3List`.
    Findings: residue ratio → 1 (structure recedes from the complete-graph
    "void" in proportion); 1D Lens collapses |S_n| onto 2^n+1 dyadic positions;
    growth exponent = 2 = NT.
  - **`theory/essays/tower_atlas.md`** — boundary section (which repo "towers"
    are P-orbit readings vs distinct constructions); dropped deprecated N_U.
  - **`algebra_tower.md`** frontier fixed; **`G150`** trimmed.

### Where the discussion landed (for the next session)

The driving question "is the residue a GAP between 2 and 3 or the UNDIVIDED
thing both are?" dissolved, not answered:

  - "gap" is the *separation-view* reading; "undifferentiated" is the
    *non-separation-view* reading; **the residue is neither — it is what both
    views read.**  Raw has no "separation/non-separation" predicate either;
    both are Lens readings (per `seed/AXIOM/05_no_exterior.md` §5.4, §6.5).
  - Formally, only `object1_not_surjective` touches the residue *itself*: it is
    the surplus outside *every* pointing-view's image.  `object1_injective` /
    `distinct_equiv` / `residue_witnessed` are each one **view's survey**, not
    the residue.
  - The "1" (`Mobius213OneAsGlue`): `det(P) = NS − NT` proves gap = glue = the
    same 1 — the **rotation axis** 2 and 3 interconvert around, not an interval.
    0 = collapse (swap-fixed diagonal); 1 = the undivided unit.  Originator's
    own words: "1이 회전축, 2-1-3 불가분."
  - Method (Mingu): to investigate the "몰루" (the indeterminate — what cannot
    be seen as any single state) you must survey **all** sides — separation and
    non-separation views both.  Every view is a variation of the most primitive
    act = **pointing (지칭)**; "Raw = the residue of pointing" is itself the
    *most primitive view*, not a final description.

## Follow-up bricks this session (open problem RESOLVED + marathon)

  - **"One closure or two?" — answered: TWO, mutually supporting.**
    `Theory/Raw/Lambek.lean` (8 PURE): `decompose` (Lambek forward, the pointing
    act is a fixed point of its constructor shape — holds for μF and νF alike)
    + `depth_drops`/`atoms_are_floor` (well-founded, selects the LEAST fixed
    point); `two_closures` bundles them — neither implies the other, Raw = μF is
    their conjunction.  Also `self_similar_peel`/`self_similar_floor` (the floor
    = fixed shape under refinement, not a stipulated stop).
  - **Method note** `research-notes/G153_method_labelling_toward_residue.md` —
    why one slips (distributional gravity toward a fixed standpoint; 213 has
    none) + the positive method (labelling is the limit and the only method;
    many labels' common shadow narrows the residue's outline; never promote a
    shadow to identity).  CLAUDE.md gained the "View promoted to identity"
    failure mode.
  - **Marathon (3 continuations of G153, all closed):**
    · #2 `Lib/Math/Real213/ObjectIsReadingScaleInvariant.lean` (4 PURE) —
      object = reading is scale-invariant (atom `Object1 : Raw→(Raw→Bool)`;
      limit `RealAsLensOutput = Nat→(Nat→Bool)`); one shape `Index→Bool`.
    · #1 `Lib/Math/SelfSimilarityBridge.lean` (3 PURE) —
      `self_similarity_two_readings`: the form reading (Raw `self_similar_floor`)
      and the count reading (`numV(m+n) = numV m · numV n`, the `5^L`
      level-replication) are one self-similarity, two Lenses.
    · #3 `Lib/Math/DualCollapseCapstone.lean` (1 PURE) —
      `every_dual_is_one_shape`: four duals (decompose/build, object/morphism,
      object/reading, difference/identity) each one shape under the pointing
      view; the shared column made explicit (convergence evidence, not capture).

## OPEN PROBLEM (the next mathematical target)

**The φ-side of self-similarity.**  `SelfSimilarityBridge` joins the *form* and
*count* readings of "same shape under descent."  The third reading — that this
self-similar descent has **fixed point φ** (`P(φ) = φ`, the residue's algebraic
image, `seed/AXIOM/05_no_exterior.md` §5.6) — is not yet tied in.  The pieces
exist PURE: `Real213/PhiCut.{phi_cut_capstone, phi_bracket_via_pell}` (φ as a
Cut), `Mobius213/TowerLInfty.tower_growth_phi_squared_bracket` (P-iteration → φ²
at levels 1..7), `Mobius213/TowerConvergence.tower_L_infty_exists`.  Target: a
bridge theorem stating the self-similar descent's limit-ratio reading is φ —
joining `self_similarity_two_readings` to the φ-fixed-point, so the three
readings (form / count / limit-ratio) are one self-similarity.  This also
connects to "걸림 = the self-fixed-point" (why φ appears): the descent that
keeps the same shape converges to φ because φ is `P`'s fixed point.

## Notes / hygiene

  - N_U = d^(d²) is **deprecated** (audit branch `claude/full-file-audit-ChymR`
    `bbd07b5`); `seed/RESOLUTION_LIMIT_SPEC.md` does not exist (stale ref).
    Don't cite N_U as a constant; don't use "ℝ = final boss" framing (AI-introduced).
  - `decide` on `Subtype`/`Raw` equality pulls `propext` via `DecidableEq Raw`;
    use `Tree.noConfusion` (for `a≠b`) and `of_decide_eq_true` (NOT
    `decide_eq_true_eq`) to stay strict ∅-axiom.  Bit me twice this session.
  - Repo-first: `PredicateSelfEncoding` already existed; I nearly rebuilt it.
    Grep + INDEX before coding a "missing" cell.
