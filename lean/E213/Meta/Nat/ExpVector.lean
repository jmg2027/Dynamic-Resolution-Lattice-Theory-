# ExpVector — the number system that fits the tower's vector-linear structure

`vp_pow` says `^` is **scalar multiplication** on the prime-exponent coordinate
(`vp_p(a^k) = k · vp_p(a)`), and `vp_mul` says `×` is **vector addition**
(`vp_p(a·b) = vp_p(a) + vp_p(b)`).  So the system the tower *natively* wants is
the **exponent lattice**: numbers as prime-indexed exponent vectors, with `×`
as `+` and `^` as scalar `·`.  This file builds it.

`vp` is the **arithmetic logarithm**: it *demotes* each rung to the previous one
(`× → +` via `vp_mul`, `^ → scalar·` via `vp_pow`) — the discrete shadow of
`log(a·b)=log a+log b`, `log(a^b)=b·log a`.  The lattice it lands on is the
log-coordinate, whose dimension jumps `1 → ∞` (count's single unit-axis → the
prime axes; atom-indistinguishability vs -distinguishability = lattice
dimension).  See frontier `general_theory_metaanalysis.md` finding G for the full
capstone (the demotion holds at every rung; canonical/flat through `^`,
gauge-dependent/holonomic above — holonomy being the gauge of the demotion).

The catch, and why it is a **setoid** not a quotient type: proving two exponent
vectors *equal as functions* needs `funext`, which is `Quot.sound`-dirty.  So
the system carries **pointwise equality** `vecEq` (a `Prop`, exactly the
`cutEq`/`ZpSeqEquiv` pattern), never `=` on functions — and stays ∅-axiom.

  * `ExpVec`, `vecAdd`, `vecSmul`, `vecEq` — the carrier and its operations.
  * `toVec` — the readout `ℕ⁺ → ExpVec`, `n ↦ (vp_p n)_p`.
  * ★ `toVec_mul` — `×` **becomes vector addition** (`vp_mul`).
  * ★ `toVec_pow` — `^` **becomes scalar multiplication** (`vp_pow`).
  * ★★ `toVec_faithful` — the readout is **injective** (`vp_separation`): the
    embedding `(ℕ⁺, ×, ^) ↪ (ExpVec, +, ·)` is faithful.
  * `toVec_finite_support` — every vector is **finitely supported**
    (`vp_eq_zero_of_gt`: zero at primes `> n`).

**Ontology note** (`theory/math/numbersystems/slot_arithmetic.md` §1).  In 213
**the tuple *is* the number**; the exponent vector is not a *readout of a primary
`ℕ`* but the **slot-presentation** of the multiplicative number itself (UFD makes
it faithful = canonical, `toVec_faithful`).  `toVec` is therefore the *iso*
between the `ℕ`-presentation and the slot-presentation of one number — not a
projection of a more-real `ℕ`.  ("`ℤ/ℚ/ℝ` are number systems" is *not* the 213
view — they name the operation-history of the axes / are flattening Lens
readouts; `ℤ` is the difference-Lens readout, itself non-faithful.)

**What this answers** (frontier `general_theory_metaanalysis.md` D′).  The
vector-linear system *exists* and is exactly the faithful, finite-support slot
that makes the **prime-exponent (multiplicative) slot the unique faithful-finite
readout** (C5).  In it the tower is linear: `×` = `+`, `^` = scalar `·`.

**Why `+` and `×` sit on the *same* floor** (the commutativity/flat window
`{1,2}`, §4 / the C2 survey): in this lattice `×` *is* addition — `toVec_mul`
makes `×` the **vector `+`** on the prime axes, so `+` (unit atoms) and `×`
(prime atoms) are the *same operation-type* (translation) at two resolutions,
hence one flat/commutative floor.  `^` is the **first non-addition**
(`toVec_pow`: scalar `·` = scaling), which is exactly where the floor — and the
commutativity — changes.  So the tower's "staircase" is by *operation type*:
translation `{+,×}` → scaling `{^}` → iterated scaling `{↑↑}` (the last is still
scalar `·`, but the scalar becomes a tower-germ — `toVec_tetration`).  The
`^`-**wall dissolves into
linear algebra**: `logₐ b` is "find the scalar `k` with `vecSmul k (toVec a) =
toVec b`", solvable iff the two vectors are **collinear** (`FoldCriterion.
fold_iff_collinear`) — no transcendence here; that **migrates to the
archimedean place** (`ln p` ℚ-independent), outside this lattice.  Above `^`,
tetration is *still* scalar `·` but the scalar is a tower-value (a germ at real
height) — the linear form survives, the scalar does not.

All ∅-axiom: pointwise (`vecEq`, no `funext`), riding `vp_mul`/`vp_pow`/
`vp_separation`/`vp_eq_zero_of_not_dvd`.

/-! ### `^` acts linearly on the lattice — and `↑↑` does not (where the algebra stops)

`toVec_pow` recovers the algebra `^` lost at the wall: in the exponent lattice
`^` *is* scalar multiplication, `toVec (a^k) = k · toVec a` — the scalar is the
**exponent `k`** (linear in the height).  This is why the lattice is the
"algebra above `×`": `×`=`+`, `^`=scalar`·`, clean ℤ-module linear algebra.

One rung up it **breaks**: tetration acts on the lattice as scalar
multiplication too, but the scalar is the **tower-value below, not the height** —
so it is *not* linear in `b`, and there is no clean module / no canonical algebra
(matching the Abel-equation non-uniqueness, frontier D).  This is the lattice
witness of "the algebra recovers through `^`, and only through `^`". -/

open E213.Meta.Nat.HyperLadder (hyperop hyperop_climb hyperop_three)

/-- ★★ **`↑↑` is non-linear on the lattice: its scalar is the tower-value.**
    `toVec (a↑↑(b+1)) = (a↑↑b) · toVec a` — tetration scales `toVec a` by the
    *previous tower value* `hyperop 4 a b`, not by the height `b+1` (contrast
    `toVec_pow`, where `^` scales by the exponent itself).  So `^` is the last
    rung acting *linearly* on the exponent lattice; above it the "scalar" is a
    tower-germ, and the module structure (the recovered algebra) ends. -/

/-! ### Flat (`^`, geodesic) vs curved (`↑↑`, holonomic) — the precise sense

The exponent reading of the height moves at **constant velocity** for `^` and
**accelerates** for `↑↑`.  In the geometric reading (the originator's intuition
that the lattice "becomes curvature-like" above `^`), the defensible core is:
`^` is a **flat connection** (the per-step increment is *constant* — a geodesic
in log-space, zero curvature), `↑↑` a **non-flat (holonomic)** one (the
increment *grows* — nonzero second difference).  The genuine invariant is the
**holonomy** (the global non-flattenability = Abel-germ = presentation-
dependence, the repo's `holonomic_modulus` regime), *not* the intrinsic Ricci
tensor (over-specific) and *not* the discrete-Forman curvature of
`DiscreteRicci` (bridge 4 = a pinned distinction, no shared generator — forcing
that identity would be a forcible map). -/

/-- ★ **`^` is a geodesic (flat): the exponent increment is constant.**
    `vp p (a^(b+1)) = vp p (a^b) + vp p a` — going one step up the height adds a
    *fixed* `vp p a` each time (`vp(a^b) = b·vp p a` is an arithmetic
    progression).  Constant velocity in log-space, zero curvature. -/
theorem vp_pow_geodesic {p a : Nat} (hp : IsPrime213 p) (ha : 0 < a) (b : Nat) :
    vp p (a ^ (b + 1)) = vp p (a ^ b) + vp p a := by
  rw [vp_pow hp ha (b + 1), vp_pow hp ha b]
  exact Nat.succ_mul b (vp p a)

/-- ★ **`↑↑` is curved: the increment is not constant.**  The first differences
    of `vp 2 (2↑↑b)` are `1, 2, 12, …` — `vp 2 (2↑↑·) = 1, 2, 4, 16, …` — so the
    second difference is nonzero (`2↑↑2 − 2↑↑1 = 1 ≠ 2 = 2↑↑3 − 2↑↑2`).  Unlike
    `^`'s constant-velocity geodesic, tetration *accelerates* — the holonomic
    (presentation-dependent) regime above the flat lattice. -/
