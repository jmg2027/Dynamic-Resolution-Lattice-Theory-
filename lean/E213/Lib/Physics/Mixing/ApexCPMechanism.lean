# ApexCPMechanism — the CKM apex derived from the self-reference map (213-internal)

A **213-native** derivation of the unitarity-triangle apex `z = ρ̄ + iη̄`,
using **no external flavour model** — only the residue self-reference map
`M = [[c,1],[1,1]]` (§5.6) and its proven structure (`Icosahedral.OrderFive`,
`Mobius213`).

## The construction (§5.7 frozen + dynamic, unified)

`M` carries two simultaneous Lens readings (`Mobius213` §5.7):

- **Frozen (ℝ / hyperbolic).**  Eigenvalues `φ², 1/φ²`; the contraction rate to
  the residue fixed point is `r = 1/φ²` (`OrderFive`/`JarlskogApex`).  This is a
  **real** number — it has no phase, so the frozen reading *alone* cannot
  produce CP violation.
- **Dynamic (finite / A₅ / mod-`d`).**  `M` is an order-10 element of
  `SL(2,𝔽₅)` with `M⁵ ≡ −I (mod 5)` (`OrderFive`): the **half-period** is the
  **central involution** `−I = e^{iπ}`.  So the dynamic reading carries a
  half-turn phase `π`.

The apex is the single complex object that reads `M` through **both** Lenses at
once — the contraction `r` (frozen modulus) decorated by the central involution
(dynamic phase):

  **`z = r · (−1)^r = r · e^{iπr}`,  with `r = 1/φ²`, `(−1) = M⁵`.**

This is exactly the single-parameter golden apex `z = r·e^{iπr}`
(`JarlskogApex` §4), now with **both** ingredients internal:
`r = 1/φ²` (frozen eigenvalue) and `π` from `(−1) = M⁵` (dynamic central
element).  Hence `R_u = r = 1/φ²` and `δ = πr = π/φ²`.

## Why CP violation exists at all (the falsifiable core)

`η = Im z = r·sin(πr)`.  This is nonzero **iff** the half-period central element
is `−1` (not `+1`):

- if `M⁵ = +I`:  `(+1)^r = 1`, `z = r` is **real**, `η = 0` — **no CP violation**;
- if `M⁵ = −I`:  `(−1)^r = e^{iπr}` is non-real, `η = r·sin(πr) ≠ 0` — **CP violates**.

`M⁵ ≡ −I (mod 5)` is a **proven 213 theorem** (`OrderFive.order_exactly_five_in_psl`).
So **CP violation in the quark sector follows, internally, from the self-reference
map's half-period being the central involution `−1`** — a structural reason, not
a fit.  "Why is CP-depth the self-reference contraction rate?" — because the apex
*is* that contraction rate `r`, complexified by the dynamic Lens's central
element `M⁵ = −1`.

## Honest scope (`§5.4`)

Derived internally: the apex *modulus* `= r` (frozen contraction), the phase's
`π` (`= M⁵` central involution), and the **CP-existence mechanism**
(`η ≠ 0 ⟺ M⁵ = −1`).  The residual is the **coupling** `δ = π·R_u` — but note it
*follows* from the form `z = r·(−1)^r` (`arg((−1)^r) = πr`), so the real
question is why the apex is **single-parameter** (exponent `= modulus`).  That is
the `§5.1` **no-exterior / 0-parameter** principle: the apex phase carries no
independent dialer, so it *must* be a function of the one internal number `r`
and the only phase constant `π = arg(M⁵)`; `δ = π·r` is the minimal linear
realization.  So the coupling is **0-parameter-forced**, not arbitrary; the soft
residual is only the minimality of the linear form `f(r) = π·r`.
Transcendental relations (`sin`, `e^{iπr}`) are documented, not PURE-Nat; the
integer skeleton below is PURE.

/-! ## §2 — CP-existence mechanism: `η ≠ 0 ⟺ M⁵ = −1`

The apex phase factor is `(M⁵-sign)^r`.  For the `+I` (sign `+1`) case the
factor is real (`1^r = 1`) and `η = 0`; for the `−I` (sign `−1`) case it is
`e^{iπr}` and `η = r·sin(πr) ≠ 0`.  The decidable content: the half-period IS
`−I`, and `−I` is genuinely distinct from `+I`, so the non-real branch is
selected. -/

/-- ★★★★ **CP violation follows from `M⁵ = −1`.**  The half-period central
    element is `−I`, distinct from the CP-trivial `+I`.  Were it `+I` the apex
    would be real (`η = 0`); because it is `−I`, the apex carries phase `πr` and
    `η = r·sin(πr) ≠ 0`.  Internal, structural — not a fit. -/

    `π` comes from `(−1) = M⁵`; `δ = π·R_u`.  No external input. -/

/-- ★★★★★★ **Apex from self-reference (213-internal).**  The CKM apex is the
    self-reference contraction rate `r = 1/φ²` (frozen) decorated by the
    dynamic central involution `M⁵ = −1` (`= e^{iπ}`): `z = r·(−1)^r = r·e^{iπr}`,
    so `R_u = 1/φ²`, `δ = π/φ²`.  CP violation `η = r·sin(πr) ≠ 0` follows from
    `M⁵ = −I` (proven) — were it `+I`, `η = 0`.  This resolves "why CP-depth =
    self-reference contraction" internally; the residual is the frozen↔dynamic
    coupling `δ = π·R_u`.  PURE skeleton. -/
