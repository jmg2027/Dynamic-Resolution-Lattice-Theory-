# DepthDoubleExp — the second axis cannot reach the second exponent layer

`DepthExponentRecursion` showed the axis tower is a self-similar recursion: a value
`c^{eₙ}` is resolved by recursing into its exponent `eₙ`.  This file proves the
*negative* fact that forces the recursion to be genuinely new at each layer — and
corrects the earlier mistaken reading that iterating `ratioLift` climbs the tower.

**The single-ratio axis `ratioN` reaches exactly `c^{polynomial}`, not the second
exponential layer.**  Concretely, the double exponential `2^{2ⁿ}` is a **fixed
point** of `ratioLift`: no number of ratio-lifts ever floors it.

The witness is that `2ⁿ` is a fixed point of `diff` (`diff_twoPow`: `Δ(2ⁿ) = 2ⁿ`),
hence of every iterated difference (`diffN_twoPow`: `diffN h (2ⁿ) = 2ⁿ`).  Through
the recursion bridge `ratioN_expSeq` (`ratioN h (c^{eₙ}) = c^{diffN h eₙ}`), this
gives `ratioN h (2^{2ⁿ}) = 2^{2ⁿ}` for *every* `h` (`ratioN_dexp`) — the value never
simplifies — so it never reaches a constant floor (`dexp_not_const`).

So the reach of the two-operator system `(ratioN, diffN)` is *exactly* `c^{poly}`
(coordinate `(h, d)` with `h` = exponent's polynomial degree, `< ω²`).  The second
exponential layer `c^{c^{poly}}` lies **strictly beyond** it: reaching it needs the
*recursion* of `DepthExponentRecursion` (apply the whole `(ratio, diff)` ladder to
the exponent), a genuinely new operation, not a longer run of `ratioLift`.

Consequence for the ordinal picture.  Each exponential layer is a new axis, and —
under the recursion — multiplies the rank by `ω` (a value's resolution depth is the
exponent's depth lifted one full axis).  So a depth-`r` finite tower of exponentials
sits at rank `ω^r · d`, the finite-`r` supremum is `ω^ω`, and reaching `ε₀` requires
diagonalising the tower *height* itself — a further meta-recursion.  **`ε₀` is not
"the end" of the axes; it is the closure of one diagonalisation, with `ε₀ + 1`,
`ε₁`, … above.**  This file pins the first non-trivial step (`ratioN` cannot cross
one exponential layer) ∅-axiom; the `ω^ω`/`ε₀` reading is the classical ordinal
interpretation of these sequence facts.

All zero-axiom.

/-- ★★★ **`ratioN h` fixes the double exponential**: `ratioN h (2^{2ⁿ}) = 2^{2ⁿ}`
    for every `h`.  Via the recursion bridge `ratioN_expSeq` (`ratioN h (c^{eₙ}) =
    c^{diffN h eₙ}`) and `diffN_twoPow` (`diffN h (2ⁿ) = 2ⁿ`): the ratio axis does a
    difference *on the exponent*, but `2ⁿ` is fixed by differences, so the value
    never changes. -/

    `h`, `ratioN h (2^{2ⁿ})` is *not* constant (it equals `2^{2ⁿ}`, which already
    differs at `n = 0, 1`: `2 ≠ 4`).  So `c^{c^{poly}}` has **no** finite `(h,d)`
    coordinate — the single-ratio axis cannot cross one exponential layer; the
    second layer needs the genuine recursion of `DepthExponentRecursion`. -/
