# DiscNegTwoSkipped — why disc −2 is *skipped* between the elliptic axes −3 and −4

The elliptic (finite-order) elements of `SL₂(ℤ)` have integer trace with `|tr| < 2`, i.e.
`tr ∈ {−1, 0, 1}`, giving discriminant `tr² − 4 ∈ {−3, −4}` — exactly the Eisenstein (`ω`, disc
−3, `tr ±1`, order 6) and Gaussian (`i`, disc −4, `tr 0`, order 4) points.  A *negative*
discriminant forces `tr² < 4`, i.e. `|tr| < 2` (elliptic), so the only negative `SL₂(ℤ)`
discriminants are `{−3, −4}`.  **Disc −2 is not among them**: it would need `tr² = 2`, i.e.
`tr = √2 ∉ ℤ` (`no_nat_sqrt_two`).  So disc −2 falls *between* the two elliptic axes and is
skipped on the crystallographic spiral axis `{2,4,6}`; `ℤ[√−2]` carries no exceptional rotation
axis (its unit group is the generic order-2 floor `{±1}`, `ImaginaryQuadraticUnitTrichotomy`'s
`unitForm_generic_axis` at `d = 2`).

Where does `√2` reappear?  **One tier up**: as `2cos(2π/8) = √2`, the trace field of **order 8** —
and `φ(8) = 4 > 2`, the *first non-crystallographic* order (the quadratic-trace lift,
`CyclotomicTraceDegree.cd_lift_orders`: `{1,2,3,4,6} ⊂ {1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12}`), where
`√2 = √NT` is the `E₇`-region surd (`why_root_two_and_root_five`).

**Summary**: disc −2 = the skipped point — no integer trace realises it (`√2 ∉ ℕ`); its surd `√2`
is the `√NT` order-8 quadratic-trace lift one tier above the spiral axis `{2,4,6}`; and `ℤ[√−2]`'s
unit group is the order-2 floor `{±1}`.

/-- ★★★ **The integer elliptic traces skip disc −2.**  The only `|tr| < 2` integer traces,
    `tr ∈ {−1, 0, 1}`, give discriminants `tr² − 4 ∈ {−3, −4}` — and **none equals −2**.  Since a
    negative discriminant forces `|tr| < 2` (elliptic), `−2` is unreachable by any `SL₂(ℤ)`
    element: it is skipped between the Gaussian axis (−4, order 4) and the Eisenstein axis (−3,
    order 6). -/
