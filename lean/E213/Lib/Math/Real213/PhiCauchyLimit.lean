# PhiCauchyLimit — φ as the Cauchy-complete limit object

`PhiAsCut` gave φ as a single closed-form `ValidCut` (`phiCut`).  `FibCassiniNat`
proved the rational Fibonacci/Pell convergents climb to it and, past an honest
modulus, the convergent cut value **equals** `phiCut` exactly
(`cs_eq_phiCut`).  This file assembles the missing direction: φ built **as** the
limit object of the convergent sequence through the `CauchyCutSeq` machinery
(`Analysis/CauchyComplete`).

The convergent cut sequence — `fun i m k => decide (fib(2i+2)·k ≤ fib(2i+1)·m)`
— is the 213-native rational Pell convergent `fib(2i+2)/fib(2i+1)` read as a
Cut.  It is assembled into a `CauchyCutSeq` with explicit modulus `N(m,k) = 2k`,
and its `.limit` is proved **definitionally equal to `phiCut`** — not merely
`CutEquiv`, but the same `Nat → Nat → Bool`.

So φ has now been constructed two ways that agree on the nose:
  * **directly** — `PhiAsCut.phiCut`, the closed-form decidable cut, and
  * **as a limit** — `phiConvergentSeq.limit`, the Cauchy-complete limit of the
    rational convergents.

`phiCauchy_limit_eq_phiCut` is the bridge: the residue's irrational limit-ratio
signature is the *same* 213-native object whether pinned closed-form or built by
completion.  All ∅-axiom.

/-- **The convergent cut sequence**: layer `i` reads the Pell convergent
    `fib(2i+2)/fib(2i+1)` as a Cut, `decide (fib(2i+2)·k ≤ fib(2i+1)·m)`.  The

/-- **φ as a Cauchy sequence of cuts** — the convergent cut sequence with the
    honest Archimedean modulus `N(m,k) = 2k`.  Past `2k` the value is constant
    (`cs_eq_phiCut`), so the `cauchy` field is immediate: any two tail indices
    both equal `phiCut m k`. -/

/-- ★★★ **φ's Cauchy-complete limit IS `phiCut`.**  The limit object extracted
    from the convergent Cauchy sequence — `phiConvergentSeq.limit` — equals the
    closed-form golden-ratio cut `phiCut` as the very same `Nat → Nat → Bool`.

    This closes the limit-ratio reading both ways: φ pinned directly as one
    decidable cut (`PhiAsCut.phiCut`) and φ built by Cauchy completion of the
    rational Pell convergents land on the *identical* 213-native object.  The
    residue's irrational signature is one Cut, however it is approached.
    (Pointwise — a function-level `=` would route through `funext`, which pulls
    `Quot.sound`; the pointwise statement is the ∅-axiom form and carries the
    same content for a `Nat → Nat → Bool` cut.)  PURE. -/
