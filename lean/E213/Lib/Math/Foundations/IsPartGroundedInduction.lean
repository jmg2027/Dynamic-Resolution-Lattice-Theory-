# ℕ-induction grounded in the distinguishing's own descent (`isPart_wf`) — ∅-axiom

The descent leg (`research-notes/frontiers/the_descent_leg.md`, `the_genesis_seam.md`) names the
central open bar: a deep discipline (factorisation / FTA) over the generated ℕ must have its
**termination grounded in `Raw`'s own descent** `Lambek.isPart_wf` (the distinguishing's
well-foundedness, proved by `Raw.rec`), **not** in Lean's borrowed `Nat.strongRecOn`.  The honest
finding there: FTA-over-`Nat213` currently completes through `Nat`'s strong recursion — so the
"generation" is still re-derivation at the descent layer.

This file supplies the missing **engine**: strong/measure induction on `ℕ` whose well-founded
recursion is `isPart_wf` itself, transported along the primitive tower `rawTower : ℕ → Raw`.  Any
descent built on `strongInduction_grounded` / `measureInduction_grounded` therefore recurses on the
*distinguishing's* descent, clearing the descent-leg bar for whatever discipline uses it.

**The grounding, exactly.**  `m < n` embeds into `TransGen IsPart (rawTower m) (rawTower n)`
(`tower_lt_transGen` — each `+1` is one `IsPart` rung, `tower_ascent_isPart`).  `IsPart` is
well-founded (`isPart_wf`), its transitive closure is too (`transGen_wf`), and well-foundedness pulls
back along `rawTower` (`InvImage.wf`) and down a subrelation (`Subrelation.wf`).  So `Nat`'s `<` is
well-founded **because the distinguishing's descent is** — the recursion engine is `isPart_wf`.

*Honest scope.*  The *embedding* lemma `tower_lt_transGen` uses `Nat` structural recursion (it proves
an inequality); the **descent engine** — the `WellFounded` that powers the recursion — is `isPart_wf`,
not `Nat.strongRecOn`.  That is the criterion the descent leg states.  ∅-axiom throughout.

/-- Each `m < n` is a chain of `IsPart` rungs `rawTower m ⟶⁺ rawTower n` — one rung per `+1`
    (`tower_ascent_isPart`). -/

/-- ★★★ **`Nat`'s `<` is well-founded, grounded in `isPart_wf`.**  Not `Nat.lt_wfRel`: this proof's
    well-founded engine is the distinguishing's own descent `isPart_wf`, pulled back along the
    primitive tower (`tower_lt_transGen` + `InvImage.wf` + `Subrelation.wf` + `transGen_wf`).  The
    descent leg's bar — termination grounded in `Raw`, not borrowed `Nat` WF — at the level of the
    induction engine. -/

/-- ★★★ **Strong induction on `ℕ`, grounded in `isPart_wf`.**  To prove `P n` for all `n`, prove it
    from all strictly-smaller values — with the well-founded recursion powered by the distinguishing's
    descent, not `Nat.strongRecOn`.  Any discipline whose descent routes through this clears the
    descent-leg bar. -/

  fun n => nat_lt_wf_via_isPart.induction n ind

/-- ★★★ **Measure induction grounded in `isPart_wf`.**  The `f`-measure descent version — the shape
    `FTA` existence needs (`Ω`-descent: peel a prime, the prime-count drops).  Powered by the
    distinguishing's descent via `strongInduction_grounded`. -/
