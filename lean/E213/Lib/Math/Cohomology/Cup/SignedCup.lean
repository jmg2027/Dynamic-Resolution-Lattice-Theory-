# Cup.SignedCup — the signed-`ℤ` cup product (the common α_em + CP infrastructure)

`Cup/Core.lean`'s cup is **Bool/ℤ-2** (the lex-projection `α(take)∧β(drop)`), where
the orientation sign collapses — flagged as the missing piece by BOTH
`AlphaEM/CupRingTrace` ("needs ℤ-signed pairings") and the CP Hodge–Riemann
pairing (`Pairing/HodgeRiemann`).  This file supplies the **signed `ℤ` cup**
(the genuine exterior/wedge product) with the orientation sign restored.

## The merge (wedge) sign

For two disjoint sorted index sets `S, T`, the wedge `e_S ∧ e_T = mergeSign(S,T)·
e_{S∪T}` with

  `mergeSign(S, T) = (−1)^{inv(S,T)}`,  `inv(S,T) = #{(s,t) : s∈S, t∈T, s>t}`

(zero if `S, T` not disjoint).  This is the sign the Bool cup loses; it makes the
cup **antisymmetric**: `e_i ∧ e_j = −(e_j ∧ e_i)`, `e_i ∧ e_i = 0`.

## The genuine signed Hodge pairing (positivity, non-vacuous)

With the signed star `⋆e_i = (−1)^i e_{{i}ᶜ}` (`SignedStarFull` on `ℝ⁴`), the
Hodge–Riemann pairing `⟨e_i, e_j⟩ = (coeff of vol in e_i ∧ ⋆e_j)` is the
**identity** `h = diag(+1,+1,+1,+1) = I` — **positive definite**.  This is the
signed-`ℤ` content that the `Pairing/HodgeRiemann` ℤ/2 stub lacked; it is the
HR2 positivity behind the CKM CP phase `= arg J = 90°`.

So the *same* signed cup closes both gaps: the α_em cup-ring (signed traces) and
the CP Hodge–Riemann positivity.

All theorems PURE.

/-- ★★★★★★ **Signed-ℤ cup product (the common α_em + CP infrastructure).**  The
    signed cup (wedge) restores the orientation sign the Bool cup collapses:
    it is **antisymmetric** (`e_i ∧ e_j = −e_j ∧ e_i`, `§2`), and its fusion with
    the signed Hodge star gives the **positive-definite** Hodge–Riemann pairing
    `h = I` (`§3`) — the non-vacuous positivity behind the CKM CP phase `90°`.
    The same signed cup is the missing ℤ-signed piece for the α_em cup-ring
    (`CupRingTrace`) and the CP pairing (`Pairing/HodgeRiemann`).  PURE. -/
