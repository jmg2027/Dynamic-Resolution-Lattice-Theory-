# DepthTower — the higher axis: ratio-lifts (logarithms) resolve the infinite depth

`DivergenceLadder` measures depth on the difference axis (`diff`, additive lifts):
finite for discrete polynomials, infinite for Liouville-type super-polynomial
growth.  But that infinity is infinity only on that axis.  This file adds the axis
above it — the ratio-lift — and shows the infinite difference-depth becomes finite
one logarithm up.  The full invariant is then a pair `(log-height, poly-depth)`.

## The two axes

  * `diff s n = s(n+1) - s n` — the additive lift; tames polynomial growth.
  * `ratioLift s n = s(n+1) / s n` — the multiplicative lift; tames exponential
    growth, exactly as `diff` tames linear growth: a geometric sequence `cⁿ` has
    constant ratio-lift (`geom_ratio_const`), the multiplicative analogue of a
    linear sequence having constant difference.

## The bridge — ratio is diff one logarithm down

The two axes are the same operator viewed through `log`:

    ratioLift (c^{e n}) = c^{diff e n}            (`ratio_is_diff_on_exponent`)

— the ratio of the values `c^{e n}` is `c` raised to the difference of the
exponents.  So `ratioLift` is `diff` conjugated by the discrete logarithm.  This is
why the higher axis resolves the infinity: a Liouville cross-determinant grows like
`c^{k!}`, super-polynomial (depth infinite) on the value/difference axis, but its
exponent `k!` is factorial-class of finite difference-depth, and `ratioLift`
reaches exactly that exponent's difference structure — one logarithm drops
Liouville from infinite depth into the finite-depth world.

## The emerging coordinate `(h, d)`

Every real sits at a lexicographic pair: `h` = how many ratio-lifts (logarithms)
until the sequence is of polynomial (finite difference-depth) class, then `d` =
that difference-depth.  algebraic `(0,0)` · e `(0,3)` · π `(0,6)` · Liouville
`(1, finite)` · tower `c^{c^{k!}}` `(2, finite)`.  The difference-axis infinity is
not a wall — it is the signal to climb one axis; the log-height `h` is a new
coordinate above the depth `d`.  The true infinity is unbounded log-height.

All zero-axiom.
