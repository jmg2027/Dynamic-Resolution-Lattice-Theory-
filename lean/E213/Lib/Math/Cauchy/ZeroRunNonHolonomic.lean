# Zero-run non-holonomicity — a bounded, growth-free non-holonomicity criterion

`NonHolonomicWitness` certifies non-holonomicity by **growth** (Klazar): `(n!)ⁿ` outgrows every
holonomic envelope.  This file gives an **orthogonal** criterion that works on *bounded*
sequences, via the **homogeneity** of a P-recursive recurrence.

A P-recursive (holonomic) integer sequence satisfies a homogeneous recurrence
`lead(n)·a(n+k) = Σᵢ qᵢ(n)·a(n+i)` with `lead` a nonzero polynomial — hence `lead(n) ≠ 0` for
all `n` past its finitely many roots.  Therefore, **once a window of `k` consecutive zeros
occurs past those roots, the recurrence forces every later term to be zero** (a zero window has
zero right-hand side, and `lead(n) ≠ 0` cancels).  So:

> **`zero_run_not_homogRec`** — a sequence with *arbitrarily long zero-runs at arbitrarily large
> positions* **and** *infinitely many nonzero terms* satisfies **no** such homogeneous
> recurrence: it is non-holonomic.

This is captured ∅-axiom for the general homogeneous-recurrence class (`HomogRec`: any
`lead·a(n+k) = R(n, window)` with `R(n, ·)` vanishing on the zero window and `lead` eventually
nonzero — strictly larger than P-recursive, so non-membership is stronger).  No growth
hypothesis, no `funext` (homogeneity is stated pointwise), no analysis.

The companion file `ZeroRunNonHolonomicWitness` exhibits an explicit bounded witness (the
indicator of the powers of two) inhabiting the criterion's hypotheses.

/-- A **homogeneous finite-window recurrence** for `a : Nat → Int` of order `k`:
    `lead n · a(n+k) = R n (window)`, where the right-hand side `R n` **vanishes on the zero
    window** (homogeneity, stated pointwise to avoid `funext`) and the leading coefficient
    `lead` is **eventually nonzero** (`lead n ≠ 0` for `n ≥ R₀`).  Every integer-valued
    P-recursive sequence satisfies one — `lead` the leading polynomial (nonzero past its roots),
    `R n` the integer-linear combination of the lower terms. -/

/-! ## §2 — the autonomous (time-invariant) finite-window machine, and its determinacy bound

A *homogeneous P-recursive* recurrence (`HomogRec`) lets the coefficients vary with `n`.  The
complementary class is the **autonomous** one — a fixed next-state rule `F` of the window,
independent of `n`: this is exactly a deterministic **finite-state machine** (time-invariant
transition) reading a length-`k` window.  `F` depends only on the window's first `k` entries
(stated pointwise, no `funext`). -/

/-- `a` is generated by an **autonomous finite-window recurrence** (a deterministic, time-invariant
    finite-state machine): a fixed `F` of the length-`k` window, `n`-independent. -/
def AutoRec (a : Nat → Int) : Prop :=
  ∃ (k : Nat) (F : (Nat → Int) → Int),

    (∀ n, a (n + k) = F (fun i => a (n + i)))

/-- ★★★ **Determinacy obstruction.**  If *some window pattern* occurs followed by **two
    different** next-values (here: a length-`k` all-zero window continued once by `v` and once by
    `v' ≠ v`, for every `k`), then `a` is generated by **no** autonomous finite-window machine.
    A deterministic FSM cannot emit two outputs from one state — the Myhill–Nerode kernel of
    "needs unbounded memory".  No pigeonhole, no encoding, no `funext`. -/

    positions carry **equal** length-`k` windows but **different** next-values, then `a` is
