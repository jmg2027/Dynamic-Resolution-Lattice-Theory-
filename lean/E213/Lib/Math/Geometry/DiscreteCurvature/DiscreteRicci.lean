# Discrete (Forman) Ricci curvature (∅-axiom)

The smooth-metric general Ricci-flow theory (Perelman `𝓕/𝓦`-monotonicity) needs
Riemannian geometry + PDE and is not treated here.  But **Ricci
curvature has a genuinely combinatorial incarnation** — *Forman–Ricci curvature*
— defined directly from cell-complex / graph combinatorics, with no smooth
manifold: a real curvature and a real Ricci flow in the discrete category.

For a triangle-free unweighted graph the Forman curvature of an edge `e = (u,v)`
is `F(e) = 4 − deg(u) − deg(v)`.  The complete bipartite graph `K_{NS,NT}` is
triangle-free, where every `S`-vertex has degree
`NT` and every `T`-vertex degree `NS`, so **every edge carries the same
curvature** `F = 4 − NS − NT`.

The sign tracks topology (discrete Gauss–Bonnet flavour):
  · `K_{1,1}` (single edge, a tree, `b₁ = 0`): `F = 2 > 0` — positively curved;
  · `K_{1,3}` (star, a tree, `b₁ = 0`): `F = 0` — flat;
  · `K_{3,2}` (`b₁ = 8`, richly cyclic): `F = −1 < 0` — negatively curved.

Negative discrete curvature ↔ positive `b₁` — the same trivial-loop ↔ rich-loop
split read off `b₁`, here read off curvature.  Edge weights + a discrete
Ricci-flow step `w ↦ w − F·w` make this an actual flow, with
convergence/normalization the target on the discrete side.

Scope: this is discrete Ricci flow (Forman/Ollivier), a genuine parallel theory,
not smooth Perelman.

/-- ★★ **Forman curvature is determined by the degree-*sum*.**  Two edges with
    the same `du + dv` carry the same curvature: `4 − du − dv` factors through
    `du + dv`.  Curvature is fixed completely by the degree-sum; its content
    "beyond a count" is a **sign** (`4 − du − dv` lives in `ℤ`), not a longer
    vector.  In particular a "same degree-sum, different curvature" collision
    is impossible — exactly what this theorem rules out. -/
