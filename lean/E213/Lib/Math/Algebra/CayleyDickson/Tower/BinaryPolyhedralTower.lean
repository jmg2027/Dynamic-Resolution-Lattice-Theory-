# The binary-polyhedral tower, fully constructed (and validated)

The exceptional `E₆–E₇–E₈` rungs are the binary polyhedral groups, each
the **double cover of a polyhedral rotation group**:

  `2T = 2·A₄`  (`|A₄| = 4!/2 = 12`,  `|2T| = 24`,  `E₆`)
  `2O = 2·S₄`  (`|S₄| = 4!   = 24`,  `|2O| = 48`,  `E₇`)
  `2I = 2·A₅`  (`|A₅| = 5!/2 = 60`,  `|2I| = 120`, `E₈`)

with `A₅ = Alt(d = NS+NT = 5)` the alternating group on the atomic slots.
Each order census is the **double-cover image of the rotation group's
class equation**, via the uniform lifting rule

  a class of order `m`, size `s`:
    `m` odd  ⇒  `s` elements of order `m`  +  `s` of order `2m`;
    `m` even ⇒  `2s` elements of order `2m`.

This file constructs the tower structurally and — crucially — **validates
the structural census against the independently enumerated one** where
both exist: the `A₄`-lift census equals `hur_order_distribution` (the
brute-force `2T`), and the `S₄`-lift census equals `octa_48_order_census`
(the brute-force `2O`).  So the ripe (class-equation) account is not just
asserted; it reproduces the enumeration.  For `2I` (`E₈`) the structural
census is the only feasible route (`IcosianClassStructure`).
