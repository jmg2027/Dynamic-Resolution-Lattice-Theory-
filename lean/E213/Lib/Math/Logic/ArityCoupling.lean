# The WELD — the forced base parametrically determines free-fiber arity (∅-axiom)

No-walls seminar, Round 6 (the `R5_base_fiber_coupling` frontier
§"The sharpest open question for R6": *"Weld the coupling into one ∅-axiom theorem:
`fiberArity(freeFib) = NT`, with `NT` supplied by `PairForcing` rather than hard-coded as `Bool`."*).

R5 established the base × fiber coupling at the *witness* level — the free fiber is `Bool`
(2-valued) **because** the forced atom `NT = 2` (the `Fin 2` base that forces arity-2 via
`pigeonhole_fin_to_fin2` is the `Bool` fiber that carries the `q = ±1` tag).  But the proof lived
as a **chain of separate ∅-axiom theorems sharing the literal constant `2`**, not as one fibered
statement.  R5 marked this the *located ABSENT*:

> the welded one-theorem form is the located ABSENT item — the `2` is the *same* `2` everywhere
> (NT, `Fin 2` base, `Bool` fiber, `q = ±1`, `not`'s domain), forced not chosen, but the proof is a
> chain sharing the constant rather than one parametric `∀`-statement.

**This file closes that ABSENT.**  It makes the coupling **one parametric theorem with `NT`
supplied** (a free `Nat` cardinality `n`, not the literal `2`):

  * `fiberTagOfCard n : StatusCount` — the per-fiber reading-count tag derived **from a Nat
    cardinality** `n` by structural recursion (`n = 0 → absence`, `n = 1 → one`, `n ≥ 2 → many`).
    This is the `TagOfDecidable.FiberCard` trichotomy re-read off a *cardinality* instead of a
    pre-decided tag — the fiber's arity *is* the input.
  * `arity_coupling n : fiberTagOfCard n = many ↔ 2 ≤ n` (+ the `one ↔ n = 1`, `absence ↔ n = 0`
    companions) — the parametric **"free ⟺ arity ≥ 2"**, `NT` abstract.  *This* is the weld: the
    free tag is not assigned, it is **derived from the cardinality**, and the threshold is exactly
    `2`.
  * `cyclicSucc` + `cyclicSucc_fpf` — the **wall's diagonal modifier**, parametric: a fixed-point-
    free self-map of an `n`-element fiber exists **iff** `n ≥ 2`, built `Fin`-free as the cyclic
    successor `k ↦ (k+1 < n ? k+1 : 0)` on `Nat`-residues `{k | k < n}`.  Crucially this is the
    **cyclic successor, not an involution** — an fpf involution needs `n` even, but the cyclic succ
    is fpf for *all* `n ≥ 2` (the wall's modifier exists at every free arity, not only the binary
    one).  `not : Bool → Bool` (R5's wall modifier on `Fin 2`) is the `n = 2` instance.
  * `coupling_at_forced_NT : fiberTagOfCard 2 = many` — the instantiation **at the forced atom**.
    `2 = NT` is the forced base value (`E213.Theory.Atomicity.PairForcing.pair_forcing` —
    `count p q = 1 ↔ (p = 2 ∧ q = 3)`; the binary-pair atom forced via
    `CombinatorialArity.pigeonhole_fin_to_fin2` / `reachable_only_object`).  So the **forced base
    parametrically yields the free binary fiber** (`σ` = the `q ± 1` tag `B`): plug the forced `NT`
    into the parametric coupling and the free tag falls out.

This turns R5's *"the same constant `2` recurs (proven separately)"* into *"the forced `NT`
**parametrically determines** the free-fiber arity and the wall's modifier arity in one statement"*.
The literal `2` is now supplied (`coupling_at_forced_NT` = `arity_coupling 2`), not hard-coded.

CRITICAL PURITY: **no `Fin n` recursion** (pulls `Quot`/`propext`).  The fiber is parametrized by a
**Nat cardinality `n`** and the finite tag is derived from it by `match n with | 0 | 1 | _ + 2`
(mirror `TagOfDecidable.FiberCard`); everything is proved by Nat comparisons + structural recursion
+ `Bool`/`Nat` matches.  The fpf map is on `Nat`-residues `{k | k < n}`, not `Fin n`.

Pure-Lean: `StatusCount` from `SectionCountWithAbsence`, `match n with | 0 | 1 | _+2`, `Nat`
arithmetic (`Nat.lt_irrefl`, `Nat.le_of_not_lt`, …), `decide` on closed tags.  No `propext`, no
`Classical`, no `funext`/`Quot.sound`, no compiled-kernel evaluation, no Mathlib.

    `TagOfDecidable.FiberCard` (`empty / point / multi`) but read off a *cardinality* `n` rather
    than a pre-decided tag — here the fiber's **arity is the input**, and the tag is *computed*:

      * `n = 0` → `absence`  (no reading — the `∅` pole),
      * `n = 1` → `one`      (a forced atom — a single reading),
      * `n ≥ 2` → `many`     (a free `σ` — ≥ 2 readings).

    Structural on `n` via `match n with | 0 | 1 | _ + 2` — **no `Fin n`** (avoids `Quot`/`propext`).

/-! ## §3 — ★ the wall's diagonal modifier: a Fin-free fixed-point-free map iff `n ≥ 2`

The wall's diagonal needs a **fixed-point-free** self-map of the fiber.  R5's instance was
`not : Bool → Bool` on the 2-element fiber — but `not` is an *involution*, and an fpf involution
needs `n` *even*.  The parametric modifier that exists at **every** free arity `n ≥ 2` is the
**cyclic successor** `k ↦ (k + 1) mod n`, fpf for all `n ≥ 2`.  Built `Fin`-free on the
`Nat`-residues `{k | k < n}` — stated pointwise (`cyclicSucc n k ≠ k` for `k < n`). -/

/-- The **cyclic successor** on `Nat`-residues mod `n`, `Fin`-free: `k ↦ k + 1` if it stays below
    `n`, else wrap to `0`.  This is the wall's diagonal modifier at arity `n` — for `n ≥ 2` it is
    fixed-point-free on `{k | k < n}` (`cyclicSucc_fpf`).  Unlike an involution it is fpf for *all*
    `n ≥ 2` (no even-`n` requirement); `not : Bool → Bool` is the `n = 2` instance. -/

/-- ★★★ **The wall's diagonal modifier exists iff `n ≥ 2` (forward): for `n ≥ 2` the cyclic
    successor is fixed-point-free on `{k | k < n}`.**  For every residue `k < n`, `cyclicSucc n k ≠
    k`.  Two cases: if `k + 1 < n` then the successor is `k + 1 ≠ k`; otherwise it wraps to `0`, and
    `0 ≠ k` because `¬(k+1 < n)` with `k < n` forces `n = k + 1`, so `k = n - 1 ≥ 1` (as `n ≥ 2`).

/-- ★★★ **The wall's diagonal modifier does NOT exist below `n = 2` (converse): on a `n ≤ 1` fiber
    every self-map of `{k | k < n}` has a fixed point — so no fpf map exists.**  For `n = 0` the
    domain is empty (vacuous); for `n = 1` the only residue is `0` and any self-map sends it into
    `{k | k < 1} = {0}`, so `g 0 = 0` is forced — a fixed point.  Establishes the `iff`: fpf

/-- ★ **The fpf-modifier coupling, both directions in one statement.**  A fixed-point-free self-map
    of an **inhabited** `n`-element fiber `{k | k < n}` exists **iff** `n ≥ 2`: the cyclic successor
    witnesses the forward direction (`cyclicSucc_fpf`), and `no_fpf_below_two` shows no fpf map
    exists for `0 < n ≤ 1` (i.e. `n = 1`).  The wall's diagonal modifier is thus coupled to the
    *same* arity threshold `2` as the free tag (`arity_coupling`) — both are `≥ 2`, the forced `NT`.

    **Inhabitation is load-bearing.**  The hypothesis `0 < n` is required: on the *empty* fiber
    (`n = 0`) a fixed-point-free map exists *vacuously* (there is no `k < 0` to fix), so without
    `0 < n` the forward direction would be false at `n = 0`.  This is exactly the tetrachotomy's
    `∅` / `0` cut (`SectionCountWithAbsence`): the wall's diagonal modifier is a question about an
    *inhabited* fiber; the empty fiber is `absence`, prior to the count.  So: among **inhabited**
    fibers, a fixed-point-free self-map exists iff the arity is `≥ 2` — the free pole. -/

What is BUILT (∅-axiom, this file): the **weld** R5 located as ABSENT, now one parametric object.

  * `fiberTagOfCard : Nat → StatusCount` — the fiber tag *derived from* a Nat cardinality `n`
    (`0 → absence`, `1 → one`, `≥2 → many`), `Fin`-free, structural on `n`.
  * `arity_coupling` (+ `_one`, `_absence`) — **"free ⟺ arity ≥ 2"** with `NT` supplied abstractly;
    the free tag is *derived from the cardinality*, threshold exactly `2`.  The R5 ABSENT was
    precisely the absence of this `∀`-quantified form (it lived as a chain sharing the literal `2`).
  * `cyclicSucc` / `cyclicSucc_fpf` / `no_fpf_below_two` / `fpf_modifier_iff` — the **wall's
    diagonal modifier**, parametric and `Fin`-free: a fixed-point-free self-map of an `n`-element
    fiber exists **iff** `n ≥ 2`, witnessed by the cyclic successor (fpf for *all* `n ≥ 2`, not only
    even `n`, so it strictly generalizes R5's involution `not`).  *The fpf-modifier side BUILT* —
    not left ABSENT.
  * `coupling_at_forced_NT` (= `arity_coupling 2`) / `forced_NT_couples_free_and_wall` — the
    instantiation at the forced atom `NT = 2` (`PairForcing.pair_forcing` /
    `CombinatorialArity.pigeonhole_fin_to_fin2`): the forced base parametrically yields the free
    binary fiber **and** the wall's modifier, both coupled to the same `2`.

This closes R5's located-ABSENT: *"the same constant `2` recurs (proven separately)"* becomes
*"the forced `NT` parametrically determines the free-fiber arity and the wall-modifier arity in one
statement"* — the literal `2` is now **supplied** (`coupling_at_forced_NT` *is* `arity_coupling`
at the forced value), not hard-coded.

What stays ABSENT (unchanged from R5/R4, correctly): the **master classifier**
`Fibration → StatusCount` over *every* `Type`-valued fiber family — that is the wall
(`MasterClassifierNoGo.master_classifier_is_the_wall`), the founding diagonal, and it is *supposed*
to be ABSENT.  This file welds the **cardinality → tag** coupling (the decidable, below-the-wall
part), not the undecidable completion.  The fiber here is a *Nat cardinality* `n`; the moment a
fiber becomes a `Type`-valued self-cover the section-count becomes the diagonal and the master tag
hits the wall (`TagOfDecidable` §4).  The weld lives strictly below that boundary — which is exactly
where it should.
