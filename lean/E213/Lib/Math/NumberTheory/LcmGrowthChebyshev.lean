# LcmGrowthChebyshev — the finitized Chebyshev 30-block bound for `lcm(1..n)`

The ζ(3) reduced presentation (`Zeta3Cut.zeta3_reduced_conditional`, input **I2**)
needs `lcm(1..n)` to grow slower than `α^{1/3} ≈ 3.236` per step, against the orbit's
`28`-geometric growth.  The clean ∅-axiom target is the **finitized Chebyshev
30-block** bound `lcm(1..n)³ ≤ 10^{43.5}·31.62ⁿ` (with `c³ = √10³ = 31.62 < 33.97 =
(1+√2)⁴`), a `7.4%`-per-`n` margin — far wider than Hanson's sub-`0.5%`, and with no
unbounded Sylvester tail.

The brick is built bottom-up; this file accumulates the chain section by section.

  * **§1 — the 30-periodic counting lemma**: `[m̃≥1] + ⌊m̃/2⌋ + ⌊m̃/3⌋ + ⌊m̃/5⌋
    ≤ m̃ + ⌊m̃/30⌋ + [m̃≥6]` for **every** `m̃` — decided on the 30 residues, then
    extended by the matching `+31`-per-`+30` increment (no induction needed: the
    `30q+r` split makes the `q`-coefficients cancel exactly).  This is the per-prime
    bucketing inequality that the key divisibility step (§2, forthcoming) folds the
    Legendre terms through, at `m̃ = ⌊30m/pʲ⌋`.

All zero-axiom.

/-! ## §1 — the 30-periodic counting lemma -/

/-- The counting inequality on a single residue block `r < 30` (decided). -/
private theorem count30_residue : ∀ r, r < 30 →
    (if 1 ≤ r then 1 else 0) + r / 2 + r / 3 + r / 5
      ≤ r + (if 6 ≤ r then 1 else 0) := by decide

/-- The indicator-free residue inequality `⌊r/2⌋+⌊r/3⌋+⌊r/5⌋ ≤ r` for `r < 30`
    (decided) — the form that survives once both indicators saturate to `1` (the
    `q ≥ 1` regime). -/
private theorem count30_residue_pos : ∀ r, r < 30 → r / 2 + r / 3 + r / 5 ≤ r := by
  decide

/-- ★★★ **The 30-periodic counting lemma**: for every `m̃`,
    `[m̃≥1] + ⌊m̃/2⌋ + ⌊m̃/3⌋ + ⌊m̃/5⌋ ≤ m̃ + ⌊m̃/30⌋ + [m̃≥6]`.

    Proof by the `m̃ = 30q + r` split (`r < 30`): the three floors split as
    `⌊(30q+r)/d⌋ = (30/d)·q + ⌊r/d⌋` and `⌊(30q+r)/30⌋ = q`, so the `q`-coefficients
    are `15+10+6 = 31` on the left and `30+1 = 31` on the right — they cancel, and
    what remains is the residue inequality (`q = 0`: `count30_residue`; `q ≥ 1`: both
    indicators are `1` and it is `count30_residue_pos`).  No exterior input; the
    period is read off the split, not assumed. -/
