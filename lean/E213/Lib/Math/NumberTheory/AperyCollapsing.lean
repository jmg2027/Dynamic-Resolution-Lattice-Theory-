# AperyCollapsing — the algebraic core of the c-increment collapsing laws

The ζ(3) numerator coefficient `c(n,k) = H₃(n) + κ(n,k)` (harmonic + kernel,
`research-notes/frontiers/zeta3_wz/numerator_plan.md`) has **both increments
collapsing** to rational multiples of the half-weight carrier
`√b = C(n,k)·C(n+k,k)` (verified exact: `zeta3_wz/verify_c_increments.py`):

    (1)  c(n,k) − c(n−1,k) = (−1)^k     · w(n,k) / (n²(n−k))     (cross-`n`)
    (2)  c(n,k) − c(n,k−1) = (−1)^{k−1} · w(n,k) / (2k³)         (cross-`k`)

with `w = 1/√b`.  This re-reads the plan's "no clean WZ certificate" as a **cap
for the `b`-only certificate language** — the extension language over `(b, √b)`
is where the numerator recurrence's Δ-calculus is fully rational
(`frontiers/exterior_as_extension.md` §6 V1).

This file deposits the **all-ℕ algebraic core** of the collapsing laws — the
three identities the ℚ-proof of (1) reduces to, in the `AperyRecurrence`
brick style (`colrec`/`lowrec`/`choose_succ_mul` + `ring_nat`):

  * `sqw_shift_n` — the half-weight's cross-`n` contiguity
    `(n+1−m)·√b(n+1,m) = (n+1+m)·√b(n,m)`; equivalently
    `t(n,m)/t(n+1,m) = (n+1−m)/(n+1+m)`, the step that collapses each kernel
    summand's cross-`n` difference to a single term.
  * `sqw_shift_k` — the half-weight's cross-`k` contiguity
    `(k+1)²·√b(n,k+1) = (n−k)(n+k+1)·√b(n,k)`; the induction step's engine
    (in ℚ: `t(n,k)·(k+1)² = t(n,k+1)·(n+k+1)(n−k)`).
  * `square_split` — the cancellation `k² + (n+k)(n−k) = n²` (`k ≤ n`); the
    "miracle" that recombines the two partial fractions of the induction step
    (`1/(k+1)² − 1/n²` producing exactly the `(n+k+1)(n−k−1)` factor).

With these three, the ℚ-level induction on `k` proving (1) is two lines per
step; the remaining Lean work is the **cleared signed-sum assembly** (the
`HL`-style clearing of `c` by a factor `ℓ` with `cube_dvd_lcm_cube`/`heart_lcm`
discharging the divisibilities, and a pos/neg split for `(−1)^k`) — recorded in
`numerator_plan.md` §"RE-READ" as the next step, not claimed here.

All zero-axiom.

/-- **The half-weight carrier** `√b(n,k) = C(n,k)·C(n+k,k)` — the integer whose
    square is the Apéry summand `b(n,k)` and whose reciprocal `w = 1/√b` carries
    both increments of the numerator coefficient `c`.  The reified operand of the
    extension move. -/

    In ℚ this is `t(n,m)/t(n+1,m) = (n+1−m)/(n+1+m)` for the reciprocal
    `t = 1/√b` — the ratio that collapses the cross-`n` difference of each
    kernel summand of `c` to the single closed term
    `t(n+1,m)·(−2m)/(n+1−m)`.  Two `colrec` applications. -/

    In ℚ this is `t(n,k)·(k+1)² = t(n,k+1)·(n+k+1)(n−k)` — the engine of the
    collapsing induction's step (with `square_split` recombining the partial
    fractions).  `lowrec` on the first factor, the absorption `choose_succ_mul`
    on the second.  Holds for all `k` (both sides vanish for `k ≥ n`). -/

/-- ★★ **The recombination square-split.**  `k² + (n+k)·(n−k) = n²` for `k ≤ n` —
    the cancellation that makes the collapsing induction's two partial fractions
    (`1/k² − 1/n²` over the common denominator) recombine into exactly the
    shifted half-weight factor.  Substituting `n = k + d` reduces it to the
    binomial square. -/

    `c(n,k) − c(n−1,k) = (−1)^k·w(n,k)/(n²(n−k))` reduces to: the two
    half-weight contiguities and the square-split.  The remaining distance to
    the law itself is the cleared signed-sum assembly (ℚ-glue), not algebra. -/
