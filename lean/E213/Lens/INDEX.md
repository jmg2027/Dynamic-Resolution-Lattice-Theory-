# lean/E213/Lens — Lens Ring

Lens is the **third ring** of the four-ring architecture (Term →
Theory → Lens → Lib).  Lens-projection plumbing: ~10 Expr nodes per
declaration (per ring-shape audit at `lean/E213/ARCHITECTURE.md`
§3.4).  Per CLAUDE.md naming: "Lens" denotes any distinguishability
output of `Raw.fold`.

| `Compose/` | 7 | Composition operators (Factoring, OnLens, Morphism, …) |
| `Foundations/` | 9 | The distinguishing as foundation: initiality (`raw_initial`), the residue-as-theorem (`FlatOntologyClosure`), the one-diagonal engine, the `DStr` classifier schema, flat-ontology + predicate self-encoding |

## `Foundations/` — the distinguishing as foundation

The corpus that establishes the distinguishing as the one self-grounding primitive and the residue as
its forced remainder:

  · `Initiality.lean`             — initiality of the Lens category (`Lens.view_unique`)
  · `SemanticAtom.lean`           — semantic-atom characterisation; **`raw_initial`** (the
                                     universal property: Raw is the initial distinguishing-structure,
                                     ∅-axiom, existence + uniqueness)
  · `FlatOntology.lean`           — flat-ontology realisation (`Object1` self-cover)
  · `FlatOntologyClosure.lean`    — `distinguishing_always_leaves_residue` (the residue is a theorem)
  · `ResidueReentry.lean`         — the residue re-enters; the cover never closes
  · `NoExteriorClosure.lean`      — naming is internal; distinguishing is downstream
  · `OneDiagonal.lean`            — one Lawvere fixed point generates Cantor / Russell / Liar / Tarski
                                     + the residue (the residue is the *engine* of the limitative thms)
  · `UniversalDistinguishing.lean`— the `DStr` schema: the distinguishing as a *classifier* (rivals
                                     are instances ≅ Raw, or fail a named clause). Uniqueness proven;
                                     existence leg open (partial-algebra engineering, no axiom needed)
  · `PredicateSelfEncoding.lean`  — closure of predicate ↔ Raw

## Foundational reading order (for newcomers, incl. AI)

A plain-language guide to this whole layer — what `Raw`/`Lens` are, why `slash` carries `x ≠ y`
(forced by the axiom + the no-`Quot.sound` rule), and what is proven vs. open — is
`theory/essays/foundations/raw_and_lens_explained.md`.  Suggested path:
`LensCore` (what a Lens is) → `Foundations/SemanticAtom.raw_initial` (the universal property,
*already proven*) → `Foundations/FlatOntologyClosure` (the residue) → `Foundations/OneDiagonal`
(residue = engine of the diagonal theorems) → `Number/Nat213/Generation` (number from the
distinguishing) → `Foundations/UniversalDistinguishing` (the schema / rival-exclusion).  The encoding question ("is the technique causing the limit?") is answered
in `theory/essays/foundations/raw_and_lens_explained.md` (§5 the universal property; §7 the
proven-vs-open scoreboard).

## Status

Per `STRICT_ZERO_AXIOM.md` §"Sealed-DIRTY inventory" (canonical; rerun
`tools/scan_all_axioms.py` for the live count): the sealed-by-design
`propext` / `Quot.sound` / `Classical.choice` uses are *structural*
(Prop-as-distinguishing `combine_sym` fields; the axiom-exhibiting bridge
lenses; elaborator plumbing).  Whole-corpus census: **0 real DIRTY**.
Lens-side distribution (the live ones):

  · `Foundations/SemanticAtom.lean` — 23  category (a) propext (Prop combine_sym)
  · `Properties/Morphism/BoolProp` — 10  category (a) propext (Bool↔Prop equating)
  · `AxiomLenses/Bridges/{Funext,QuotSound}` — 2  axiom-exhibiting bridge lenses (by design)

The Lens-funext family (`Instances/Leaves/DepthJoin`, `Universal/QuotLens`,
`Lattice/IndexedJoin`, `Instances/Cauchy`, `Instances/FunctionSpace`) is
**fully PURE** (see `STRICT_ZERO_AXIOM.md`).  All other Lens modules are PURE;
scanner reports zero unsealed DIRTY.
