# The two folds generate a Klein four-group on the fixture; the third involution is fixed-point-free

`FoldDuality` showed negation `negQ` and reciprocal `recQ` are mirror involutions on the four-point
fixture `Q4 = {∞, 0, +1, −1}`: each fixes the two-element orbit the other swaps.  Composing them
closes the symmetry: `negQ` and `recQ` commute, and their composite

  `bothSwap := negQ ∘ recQ = recQ ∘ negQ`

is the **third non-identity involution** — it **swaps both** orbits at once (`0 ↔ ∞` *and*
`+1 ↔ −1`) and so is **fixed-point-free**.  Together with the identity, `{id, negQ, recQ, bothSwap}`
is the **Klein four-group** `ℤ/2 × ℤ/2` acting on the fixture, and the three non-identity elements are
completely distinguished by **which orbit they fix**:

  - `negQ` — fixes `{0, ∞}` (the zero-infinity / hole pair), swaps `{±1}`;
  - `recQ` — fixes `{±1}` (the units), swaps `{0, ∞}`;
  - `bothSwap` — fixes **neither** (the antipode, fixed-point-free).

So the additive fold, the multiplicative fold, and their composite exhaust the involutive symmetries
of the hole/unit fixture: the two founding folds are the two reflections whose product is the central
antipode, and the residue pair `{0, ∞}` and the unit pair `{±1}` are the two axes they act on.
