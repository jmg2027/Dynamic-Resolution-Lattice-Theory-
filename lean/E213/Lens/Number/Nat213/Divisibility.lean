# Lens.Number.Nat213.Divisibility — a discipline computed OVER the Raw-generated ℕ₊ (∅-axiom)

The **descent leg** (narrative: `theory/essays/foundations/raw_and_lens_explained.md`): the corrected
true intent asks that a classical discipline be *generated from the distinguishing*, not re-derived over
Lean's `Nat` and
bridged.  `Nat213.Peano` is the Raw-generated positive naturals — `one := Raw.a`,
`succ := slashOrSelf · Raw.b` (the successor *is* the distinguishing operation), with its own
`add`/`mul` and the no-zero/no-subtraction/no-absorption shape *forced* by the primitive
(`no_additive_identity_at_one`, `no_closed_subtraction`, `no_absorbing_element`).

This file is the first **discipline** (elementary divisibility) proven **entirely over `Nat213`** —
`dvd` is defined by `Nat213`'s own `mul`, and every theorem's statement *and proof* stay on `Nat213`
with **no detour through Lean `Nat`**: the whole dependency cone is `toNat`-free, verified
mechanically (the descent-leg "toNat-cone bet", the `the_descent_leg` frontier).  The
one cancellation it needs (`dvd_antisymm` → `mul_left_cancel`) is taken from `Order` — the **native**
version (trichotomy + distributivity, mirroring `Order.mul_self_inj`), not `Peano`'s earlier
`toNat`-laundered one.  It is the first concrete leg-2 deposit: a number-theoretic preorder computed
on the distinguishing's own counting object, generated all the way down.  ∅-axiom.

The structure is genuinely shaped by the primitive: divisibility here is a preorder with bottom
`one` (`one_dvd`, since `Raw` has the atom) but — unlike ℕ-with-0 — **no top** and no zero to absorb,
matching `Peano`'s forced no-absorption.

/-- **Divisibility over the Raw-generated ℕ₊**: `a ∣ b` iff `b = a · c` for some `c : Nat213`,

/-- **A product is `one` only if both factors are** — over the Raw-generated ℕ₊.  Forced by the
    no-zero structure: a `succ`-headed factor makes the product `succ`-headed (`add` of a positive
    is always a successor), hence `≠ one` (`succ_ne_one`).  A genuine number-theoretic fact on
    `Nat213`, not Lean `Nat`. -/

/-- ★★★ **Antisymmetry**: `a ∣ b → b ∣ a → a = b` — so divisibility is a **partial order** on the
    Raw-generated ℕ₊, not merely a preorder.  The proof routes through `mul_left_cancel` (every
    `Nat213` is cancellable — positivity, no zero-divisor) and `mul_eq_one`: `a = a·(x·y)` forces
    `x·y = one`, hence `x = one`, hence `b = a`.  Entirely over `Nat213`. -/

/-- **A divisor is no larger than its dividend**: `a ∣ t → a = t ∨ a < t` (the native `Nat213`
    order `lt`).  Purely over `Nat213` — `c = one` gives equality (`mul_one`); `c = succ c'` gives
    `t = a + a·c'` (`mul_succ_right`), i.e. `a < t`.  Divisibility refines the additive order. -/

/-- **A divisor is `≤` its dividend** — `a ∣ t → a ≤ t`.  Divisibility refines
    the additive order: this is exactly `dvd_imp_eq_or_lt` read through
    `Order.le` (`le a t = (a = t ∨ lt a t)`).  The bridge between the
    multiplicative (`Dvd`) and additive (`le`) disciplines on `Nat213`. -/
theorem dvd_imp_le {a t : Nat213} (h : Dvd a t) : le a t := dvd_imp_eq_or_lt h

/-- **The base divides its higher powers** — `a ∣ a^(n+1)`.  `a^(n+1) = a · a^n`, so `a` is the
    left factor (`dvd_mul_right`). -/

  rw [pow_succ]; exact dvd_mul_right a (pow a n)

/-- ★ **Powers are monotone for divisibility** — `m ≤ n → a^m ∣ a^n`.  Equality gives `dvd_refl`;
    `m < n` gives `n = m + c`, so `a^n = a^m · a^c` (`pow_add`) and `a^m` is the left factor.
    The `pow`-level twin of `dvd_imp_le`'s order/divisibility bridge. -/

  · exact dvd_refl (pow a m)
  · obtain ⟨c, hc⟩ := hlt
    exact ⟨pow a c, by rw [← hc, pow_add]⟩

/-- **The base divides every one of its powers** — `a ∣ a^n` for all `n`.  Always holds (no zero
    exponent: `Nat213` has no zero, so `n ≥ 1` and `a^1 = a`); `a^1` gives `dvd_refl`, `a^(k+1)`
    gives `dvd_pow_self`. -/

  cases n with
  | one => rw [pow_one]; exact dvd_refl a
  | succ k => exact dvd_pow_self a k

/-- ★★★ **No top**: no `t` is divisible by every `Nat213`.  Divisibility over the Raw-generated ℕ₊
    has a bottom (`one`) but **no top** — the shape *forced* by the primitive: every element is
    exceeded by its successor (`add_one_right`), the distinguishing's counting never closing
    (cf. `Peano.no_absorbing_element`).  Unlike a bounded divisibility lattice, this order is open
    upward.  Entirely over `Nat213`. -/

  · rw [heq] at htlt; exact lt_irrefl t htlt
  · exact lt_irrefl t (lt_trans htlt hlt)

/-- ★★★ **Divisibility is a preorder on the Raw-generated ℕ₊, with bottom `one` and no zero.**
    The first elementary discipline (divisibility) computed entirely over `Nat213` — the
    distinguishing's own counting object — with the no-absorbing-zero shape forced by the primitive
    (`Peano.no_absorbing_element`).  The descent leg made concrete for one discipline. -/
