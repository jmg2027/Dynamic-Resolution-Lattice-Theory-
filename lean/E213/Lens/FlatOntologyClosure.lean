# Lens.FlatOntologyClosure — the self-covering closure, exactly up to the residue

`FlatOntology` realises every sort (object / type / relation / function / Lens)
as one primitive: a decidable predicate on `Raw^n`.  It defers the *closure*
direction — encoding a predicate back as a Raw (`seed/AXIOM/06_lens_readings.md`
§6.3; `research-notes/G29_residue.md` "자기-덮음").

This file records the *limit* shape of that closure:

  * **Faithful**: `Object1 : Raw → (Raw → Bool)` (each Raw as its own indicator
    `· = r`) is **injective** — Raw self-covers as predicates with nothing lost.
  * **Not total**: `Object1` is **not surjective** — the predicates *not* of the
    form `· = r` are exactly the Cantor-unpointable surplus
    (`Cardinality.cantor_raw_bool`).  That surplus is the **residue**: the part
    of the predicate algebra the substrate cannot point at as a single Raw.

The complementary *positive* direction is already closed in
`Lens/PredicateSelfEncoding.lean`: every **finite-prefix / definable** predicate
DOES encode back to a Raw (`predicateToRaw`, `predicate_self_encoding_closure`,
all ∅-axiom).  Together: definable predicates round-trip (positive closure), the
full predicate space does not (this file) — and the gap between "definable" and
"all" is exactly the residue.  So the self-covering "closes exactly up to the
residue": faithful and round-tripping on what can be pointed at / described, with
the unpointable surplus being the residue itself.  This is the ∅-axiom statement
of the session thesis: pointing
is finite; the completed-infinite surplus is a finite *name*, not an inhabitant.

/-! ## A concrete residue witness — the undifferentiated predicate

`object1_not_surjective` is the abstract gap (Cantor).  Here is a *named*
inhabitant of it, tying the gap to the session's "미분화 / undifferentiated"
notion: the **constant-true predicate** `fun _ => true` — the predicate that
draws no distinction at all (the `Raw → Bool` shadow of `constLens`) — is not in
the image of `Object1`.  Each `Object1 r` is true at exactly one Raw, so it can
never equal a predicate true everywhere (there are ≥ 2 Raws, `a ≠ b`).

So the residue is not merely a cardinality surplus: its cleanest concrete member
is the *undifferentiated* reading itself — the one predicate that points at
nothing-in-particular cannot be pointed at as any single Raw. -/

/-- The constant-true (undifferentiated) predicate on Raw. -/
def undifferentiated : Raw → Bool := fun _ => true

/-- No Raw's indicator equals the undifferentiated predicate: pick a Raw `≠ r`
    (the other atom), where the indicator is `false` but `undifferentiated` is
    `true`. -/

    Object1 r ≠ undifferentiated := by

/-- ★★ **The residue, named.**  The undifferentiated predicate inhabits the
    Cantor gap of `object1_not_surjective`: it is a `Raw → Bool` with no Raw
    preimage under `Object1`.  The faithful self-cover closes *exactly* up to
    this — the part the substrate cannot point at as a single Raw is led by the
    reading that draws no distinction. -/
