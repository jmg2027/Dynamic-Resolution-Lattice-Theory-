# PathLens: non-commutative-combine witness

`pathLens : Lens (List Bool)` with `base_a = [false]`,
`base_b = [true]`, `combine = List.append`.

**Role.**  Every other Lens in the catalogue uses a *commutative*
combine (depth/leaves/signed use `+` or `max`; Bool lenses use
`and/or/xor` which are all commutative).  `pathLens` is the first
deliberately *non-commutative* witness.

**Consequences.**

1. `pathLens` is **not** an instance of `CommBinaryCodomain`
   (which bundles `combine_comm`).  Its combine is genuinely
   asymmetric: `append [false] [true] ≠ append [true] [false]`.

2. The Lens's view remains well-defined on Raw, because `Raw.slash`
   canonicalises child order.  Concretely,
   `pathLens.view (Raw.slash b a h) = pathLens.view (Raw.slash a b h')`:
   the two Raw terms are literally equal (`Raw.slash_comm`), so the
   views coincide.  The "order" of the list is dictated by Raw's
   internal `cmp`-canonical form, *not* by how the user wrote the
   slash.  This illustrates §1 of the paper: the axiom's "between"
   is directionless, and no Lens can recover a notional ordering.

3. `pathLens` is R5-compatible on the level-≤2 enumeration (5
   distinct Raw terms ↦ 5 distinct lists, table below).  Full
   injectivity on all Raw is not proved here — but also not
   needed for the R12-failure point.
