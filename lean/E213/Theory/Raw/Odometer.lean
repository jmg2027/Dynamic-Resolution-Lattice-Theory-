# Theory.Raw.Odometer — the `+1` adding machine on bit-streams; the carry is the residue unit

The shift (`CoResidue` §19) is one of the two fundamental maps on the bit-stream space
`Nat → Bool`; the other is the **odometer** — the `+1` adding machine (least-significant-bit-first
binary increment with carry).  This file builds it ∅-axiom and reads its carry as the residue
unit, so the µF/νF mirror appears at the arithmetic-odometer scale:

  * the carry starts at the unit (`carry f 0 = true`, the `+1`) and survives into position `n+1`
    only through a `1` at `n` — it propagates through the *leading run of 1s*;
  * the carry **terminates iff the stream has a floor** (a `false` / `0`),
    `carry_dies_iff_has_false`.  A stream with a floor resolves the `+1` locally — the µF face
    (the descent terminating at an atom, `Lambek.terminal_iff_atom`); the **all-`true`** stream
    has the carry running *forever* (`allTrue_carry_forever`) — the `+1` escaping to a new rung,
    the νF face (`MuNuMirror.ascent_unbounded`);
  * and the all-`true` stream is exactly the seed of the canonical νF escape `spineL`
    (`CoResidue.spineL_eq_boolSpine_true`): so the residue escape *is* the odometer overflow —
    the `+1` that never lands wraps the 2-adic `…111` to `…000` (`odo_allTrue`).

The mathematics is the 2-adic odometer (a known object — the adding machine / Vershik–Bratteli
`+1`); the 213 reading is that its `+1` IS the self-pointing act, its carry IS the residue unit
(`Lens/Number/SharedUnitAcrossReadings`), and its non-terminating overflow IS the νF escape.
All ∅-axiom, pointwise (Bool computation + finite induction; no `funext`).

/-! ## §2 — the successor dynamics: the `+1` is injective and interlocks with the descent

The two fundamental maps on the bit-streams are the **descent** (the shift `σ`, drop the
least-significant bit — the µF face, `CoResidue` §19) and the **ascent unit** (the odometer `+1`,
the νF face).  This section shows how they interlock, and that the `+1` is the residue's
*injective* successor:

  * **the carry recursion** — `carry f (n+1) = f 0 && carry (shift f) n` (`carry_shift`): the
    carry passes position `0` only through the low bit, so it is the low bit *conjoined* with the
    shifted carry;
  * **the descent–increment skew** — `σ (odo f) = odo (σ f)` gated by the low bit
    (`shift_odo`): dropping the low bit after incrementing equals incrementing the tail *iff* the
    low bit was `1` (the carry propagated), else it is just the descent — the adding-machine
    recursion, the precise way the `+1` and the descent commute;
  * **the `+1` never collides** — `odo` is *injective* (`odo_injective`): the residue's
    successor never sends two streams to one, the odometer-scale form of `tower_no_cycle` /
    no-exterior (`MuNuMirror`: the ascent never returns).

All ∅-axiom, pointwise (Bool computation + finite induction). -/

/-- ★★ **The carry recursion.**  `carry f (n+1) = f 0 && carry (shift f) n`: the carry reaches
    position `n+1` only by passing the low bit `f 0` *and* the carry of the shifted stream — the
    leading run of `1`s, split off one bit at a time. -/

/-- ★★★ **The descent–increment skew relation.**  `shift (odo f) n = (shift f n) xor (f 0 &&
    carry (shift f) n)`: descending after the `+1` is the descent value corrected by the carry,
    which passes only through the low bit.  Reading the cases: when `f 0 = true` the right factor
    is `carry (shift f) n`, so `shift (odo f) = odo (shift f)` (the `+1` propagated to the tail);
    when `f 0 = false` it is `false`, so `shift (odo f) = shift f` (the `+1` stopped at bit 0).

/-- ★★★ **The residue's successor is injective.**  `odo f = odo g` (pointwise) ⟹ `f = g`: the
    `+1` adding machine never sends two distinct streams to one.  By induction on the bit
    position — the output bit `odo f n = f n xor carry f n`, the carry fixed by the lower bits
    (`carry_congr`), so `xor`-cancellation (`xor_right_cancel`) recovers `f n = g n`.  This is the
    odometer-scale `tower_no_cycle` (`MuNuMirror`): the act of adding the unit never returns, the
    no-exterior signature read on the `+1`. -/

    (`shift_odo` — the `+1` and the shift commute through the carry, gated by the low bit), the
    carry itself splitting one bit at a time (`carry_shift`).  Together with §1 (the carry
    terminates iff there is a floor; the canonical escape is the overflow), this makes the
    odometer the residue's complete successor structure: the ascent unit `+1` as an injective
    dynamical system interlocking with the µF descent.  ∅-axiom. -/

/-! ## §3 — the predecessor `−1`: the residue unit generates a `ℤ`-action (the `+1` is invertible)

The odometer is the residue's `+1`; its inverse is the `−1` adding machine — the **predecessor**,
which *borrows* instead of carrying.  The borrow starts at the unit and propagates through the
leading `0`s (subtracting `1` from `…0` borrows past every `0`), dual to the carry propagating
through the leading `1`s.  The two are mutually inverse (`dec_odo`, `odo_dec`), so the `+1` is a
**bijection** of the residue's bit-stream space, with the `−1` its inverse — the residue unit,
read as the difference-Lens generator (`theory/essays/analysis/integers_as_difference_lens.md`),
generates a `ℤ`-action `(±1)` on the escape space.  Injective (§2) + invertible here: the unit's
action is free of collapse, the no-exterior signature made a group action.  All ∅-axiom. -/

    `+1` and `−1` the difference-Lens generators
    (`theory/essays/analysis/integers_as_difference_lens.md`) of a `ℤ`-action.  The act of adding

/-! ## §4 — the µF/νF reversibility asymmetry: descent forgets, the ascent unit remembers

The two fundamental maps differ sharply in *reversibility*.  The **descent** (shift `σ`) is
**surjective but not injective** — it is a forgetful quotient: every stream is some stream's tail
(`shift_surjective`), but distinct streams that agree from position `1` on collapse to the same
tail (`shift_not_injective`), the dropped least-significant bit being lost.  The **ascent unit**
(odometer `+1`) is **bijective** (§2 injective + §3 invertible): it loses nothing and is always
undoable.

So the µF face grounds *irreversibly* (descent discards information, bottoming out at an atom —
`Lambek.terminal_iff_atom`), while the νF ascent unit escapes *reversibly* (the `+1` is a `ℤ`-action,
`odo_unit_action`).  Reversibility is the operational signature of the asymmetry: grounding forgets,
the unit remembers.  All ∅-axiom. -/

  ⟨cons false f, shift_cons false f⟩

/-- ★★ **The descent is not injective (it forgets).**  Two streams agreeing from position `1` on
    but differing at position `0` (`cons true c` vs `cons false c`) have the *same* tail under the
    shift — the dropped least-significant bit is lost.  So the descent is a forgetful quotient,
    not reversible. -/

/-! ## §5 — the odometer is the `ℤ₂`-successor homeomorphism (bijective + continuous)

The bit-stream space `Nat → Bool` is the residue's escape carrier; under the product (Cantor)
topology it is the `2`-adic integers `ℤ₂ = lim ℤ/2ᵏ`.  The odometer is the `+1` on it, and it is a
**homeomorphism**: bijective (§3, `dec` the inverse) and **continuous** — each output bit `n`
depends only on the input bits `≤ n` (`odo_prefix_determined`), the carry reaching no further than
it has seen.  So the residue's `+1` is the `ℤ₂`-successor as a topological group automorphism: the
escape space carries the `2`-adic integer structure, generated by the residue unit.  ∅-axiom. -/

/-- ★★★ **The odometer is continuous (prefix-determined).**  `odo f n` depends only on the input
    bits at positions `≤ n`: if `f` and `g` agree on `[0, n]` then `odo f n = odo g n` — the carry
    reaches no further than the bits it has passed (`carry_congr`).  This is continuity in the
    Cantor topology, making `odo` a well-defined map on `ℤ₂ = lim ℤ/2ᵏ`. -/

    bit determined by a finite input prefix).  So the residue unit generates the `ℤ₂`-successor as a
