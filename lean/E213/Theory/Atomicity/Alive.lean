# Alive predicate: derived from Clause 4 recursive application

**Status**: this file's previous "postulated, not
derived" framing has been **superseded** by the structural
derivation in `Theory/Atomicity/AliveDerivation.lean` (research
note ).

## Derivation summary

The "alive" predicate (both atom-multiplicities odd) is **derived**
from Clause 4 of the 213 axiom (`seed/AXIOM/02_axiom.md` §2.2 #4:
no self-pair `x/x`) **applied recursively at the count-Lens group
level**.

User insight:
  > "Raw는 트리 형태가 아니다.  모든 Raw는 연산이기도 하고 객체이기도
  >  하기 때문 — 즉 애초에 연산과 객체도 정의되지 않은 상태이다."
  > "객체 간의 관계도 객체일거고.  타입도 객체일거고."

If every Raw event is simultaneously operation and object, Clause 4
is not restricted to atomic Raw distinguishables — it applies at
every granularity, including **groups of Raw viewed as objects**.

For decomposition `n = 2a + 3b`: if `a` is even, the a binary-pair
atoms can themselves be grouped into a/2 pair-of-pairs — a Clause-4
violation at the binary group level.  So `a` must be odd; similarly
for `b`.

The "both odd" alive predicate is therefore the **count-Lens readout
of recursive Clause 4**, not a separate postulate.

## Lean bridge

  · `AliveDerivation.IsSelfPaired n := ∃ k, n = 2 * k` —
    binary group-level self-pair structure (Clause 4 forbidden)
  · `AliveDerivation.IsClause4Alive (a b) := ¬IsSelfPaired a ∧ ¬IsSelfPaired b`
  · `AliveDerivation.alive_iff_clause4_alive : IsAlive a b ↔ IsClause4Alive a b`
    — the formal dissolution (PURE)

This file retains the arithmetic surface-form of `Survives`/`Alive`
for compatibility with `Five.lean`, but the postulate-status caveat
is lifted.

(Former versions also appealed to "Raw's rule `x ≠ y`" as a
distinctness source.  That appeal is retired; the actual derivation
goes through Clause 4 recursive application as documented above.)
