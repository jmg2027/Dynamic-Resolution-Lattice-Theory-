## Terms (canonical)

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **PURE** | `#print axioms <thm>` returns "does not depend on any axioms".  Identical to "strict ∅-axiom".  This is the standard target. |
| **DIRTY** | `#print axioms` returns "depends on axioms: [...]" with a non-empty list.  Any of `propext`, `Quot.sound`, `Classical.choice`, `Lean.ofReduceBool` (from `native_decide`), `sorryAx`. |
| **sealed-DIRTY-by-design** | A DIRTY theorem accepted because (a) Lean-core boundary (well-founded recursion, Lean.Elab metaprogramming inheriting Classical.choice via the Lean.Elab.Command monad), or (b) Lens funext-by-design (higher-order Lens equality requires funext on the combine field, refactoring would redefine what "Lens equality" means).  Listed in `tools/scan_all_axioms.py` `SEALED_DIRTY_PREFIXES`. |
| **real DIRTY** | DIRTY ∧ NOT sealed-by-design.  This is the regression budget. |

**The 213 axiom set is ∅** — a theorem meets the standard iff PURE.

**Forbidden absolutely** (per `seed/AXIOM/04_falsifiability.md` §5.2.1, falsifiability
trigger): `Classical.choice` and `Lean.ofReduceBool` in **213
mathematical content** (theorems about Raw, Lens, observables).
Tactic files (`E213.Meta.Tactic.*`) that inherit Classical.choice
purely via the Lean.Elab.Command monad are *plumbing*, not 213-math
content; sealed under (a) above with explicit justification.

**Always allowed but not target**: `propext` and `Quot.sound` are
part of the Lean 4 core kernel base.  213 aims to avoid them where
possible (PURE target) but does not falsify if a result requires
them via Lean-core well-founded recursion proofs.

## Latest scan

(Numbers vary by run due to scanner timeouts on slow modules; refer
to HANDOFF.md "current state" for the freshest reading.  994 total
`.lean` files; scanner enumerates ~500-800 ★-marked theorems
depending on timeout state.)

**2026-05-09** (post-Möbius-extension session, pre-merge audit):
seal list updated to use single-`Lens.*` prefixes (was `Lens.Lens.*`
— stale from earlier nesting).  Tree-wide scan after seal-list fix
reports **2491 PURE / 75 DIRTY + 89 sealed-DIRTY-by-design** (2655
total).  Real DIRTY breakdown: 32 [propext, Quot.sound] + 32
[propext] + 7 [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] +
2 [Quot.sound] + 2 [propext, Quot.sound] (split format).

The 75 real DIRTY items are **pre-existing** from before the
Möbius-extension session.  All 102 ∅-axiom theorems newly added
in `Theory/Nat213/` + `Theory/Tower/` + `Lib/Math/UniverseChain/
MobiusChain.lean` are PURE.

Topical breakdown of remaining DIRTY:
- Lens.Leaves.DepthJoin (10): JoinEquiv-on-Raw uses Classical.choice
- Lens.Morphism.BoolProp (10): BoolProp morphisms via propext
- Lib.Math.CayleyDickson.CayleyHeavy (6): heavy ring polynomial
  identities via simp
- Lens.Universal.QuotLens (5): Lens funext-by-design
- Lib.Math.CayleyDickson.ZOmegaDomain (5): ring axioms via simp
- Lens.Instances.Swap, Sum, CompoundBool (3-4 each): Lens patterns
- Misc Lens + Math files (1-3 each): scattered residuals

These need separate marathons; many would seal under expanded
"Lens funext-by-design" or "heavy polynomial identity" categories,
but proper triage requires per-theorem inspection.

**2026-05-05** (post-AXIOM.md §9.1 rename audit pass): tree-wide
scan reports approximately **541 PURE / 18 DIRTY / 14 sealed-DIRTY-
by-design** (573 total counted).  Real DIRTY breakdown: 10 [propext]
+ 7 [propext, Quot.sound] + 1 [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
(NativeGuard internal; Classical.choice via Lean.Elab API, sealed
upstream).  Compared to pre-rename 2026-05-04 baseline (511/14/22),
the rename caused +30 PURE (newly counted), +4 DIRTY (newly counted
pre-existing items), -8 sealed (entries reclassified after seal-list
update for `Meta.SelfRecognising` + `DeriveConjugationCodomain` +
`VerifyConjugation`).  No new actual axiom dependencies were
introduced by the rename.

**Earlier session 27 milestone (2026-05-03)**: scan reported **2077
PURE / 0 real DIRTY / 19 sealed**.  The 2077 count reflected a more
permissive scanner regex catching additional ★-marked theorems
across the Real213 marathon.  Cumulative arc 394 → 0 real DIRTY
across sessions 19-27 via Plan 2 parallel-struct refactor PLUS
deletion of ALL function-eq facade + consumer migration to `_at`
pointwise form.

**Genuine final state** (no cheat seal):
  - The function-eq facade across Phase capstones, Flux*/FTC*
    capstones, ClassicCalc/Passthrough/HasDyadicMVTWitness struct
    families, and leaf cut lemmas (CutMulOne/SumZero/PowConst/MidSelf)
    has been **completely deleted**.  All ~25 consumer files
    migrated to use only `_at` pointwise variants.
  - Function-eq cut equality on `Nat → Nat → Bool` would require
    funext = Quot.sound — but it's no longer needed: every theorem
    is now stated and proved pointwise.
  - The 6 propext-bearing residuals (CubeDerivativeAtZero × 3,
    PolySumDerivativeModulus × 3) refactored using
    cutSumAux_congr / cutMulOuter_congr cascades + manual Nat
    arithmetic avoiding `omega`/`Nat.max_eq_left`.

**The 19 sealed items** are mathematically inherent (NOT facade):
  - Lean-core boundary: Nat.lcm/gcd/add_mod/Int from kernel use
    propext via well-founded recursion proofs (8 modules).
  - Lens funext-by-design: higher-order Lens equality requires
    funext on the combine field — restating it would redefine what
    Lens IS (~18 modules under SEALED_DIRTY_PREFIXES).
  - SemanticAtom: Iff/propAsDistinguishing inherently uses propext
    (the "atom of meaning" thesis).
  - Math.Infinity.Godel: Cantor-style countability/equipotence
    proofs use Iff between cardinality propositions.
  - DyadicTrajectory: Cauchy-limit structural inequality preserved by
    ∅-axiom regime; documented in `seed/RESOLUTION_LIMIT_SPEC.md` §1.
  - Bridges: intentional axiom-demonstration cluster.

**This is the canonical 213 axiom standard** (formalized 2026-05-02,
CLAUDE.md `## Strict ∅-axiom standard`).  The 213 axiom set is ∅.

A theorem in `lean/E213/` meets the standard iff `#print axioms`
returns:
> "does not depend on any axioms"

Equivalently: no `propext`, no `Quot.sound`, no `Classical.choice`,
no `native_decide`, no `sorryAx`.

This file maintains the running catalog of theorems that meet the
standard.  Theorems still on the migration backlog
(carrying `[propext, Quot.sound]` from `omega` / `funext` / etc.) are
listed in CLAUDE.md `## Strict ∅-axiom standard → Migration backlog`.

Verification: `python3 tools/scan_axioms.py <module>` — every
theorem reports `[PURE]` (meets the standard) or `[DIRTY]` with
the exact axiom dependency listed.

  - All atomic structural identities (NS·NT=6, d²-1=24, etc.)

## Significance

STRICT 0-AXIOM is the **absolute best** epistemic position in
Lean.  These theorems are checked by Lean's kernel WITHOUT any
axiom dependence — purely definitional.

External reviewers cannot challenge these via "what if propext
is wrong" since propext is not used.

## omega → propext lesson

Lean's `omega` tactic typically introduces propext + Quot.sound
dependencies.  Replacing omega with explicit kernel-level Nat
lemmas (Nat.succ_add, Nat.zero_add, etc.) UPGRADES proofs to
STRICT 0-AXIOM.

Example (commit 304723f):
  Before: `have : k+1+N = (k+N)+1 := by omega`  → propext dep
  After:  `rw [Nat.succ_add k N]`  → STRICT 0-AXIOM

## omega → decide lesson (Phase 5 batch 1, commit 08b02e1)

For `by omega` calls used purely for **decidable bounds on literals**
(e.g. `(by omega : 0 < 3)` or `(by omega : 1 < 5)`), `by decide`
is a strict 0-axiom drop-in.  In Phase 5 batch 1, 111 such
omega calls across 19 files in `Math/Cohomology/Dyadic/`
were converted, with the following measured upgrades:

  - `pellFSMmod3_has_degree2` : [propext, Quot.sound] → STRICT 0
  - `tribFSMmod2_has_degree3` : [propext, Quot.sound] → STRICT 0
  - `number_theory_213_capstone` (v1) : [propext, Quot.sound] → [propext]
  - `number_theory_213_capstone_v2`    : [propext, Quot.sound] → [propext]
  - `number_theory_213_capstone_v3`    : already [propext]
  - `pell_crt_capstone`, `pell_crt_fsm_capstone` : [propext] (kept)
  - `pisano_crt_framework_complete`   : STRICT 0 (kept)
  - `pellLens_3x5_period_20` (etc.)   : [propext] (kept)

The Quot.sound was being dragged in by inner `omega` calls in the
HasDegree witnesses (`⟨n, by omega, m, fun _ => rfl⟩`) — pure decidable
positivity that `decide` handles strictly axiom-free.  Capstones
dropping Quot.sound is a **genuine epistemic upgrade** at the trust
contract level: anything ≤ {propext, Quot.sound} is DRLT-allowed,
but the strict-0 standard rejects Quot.sound — so v1 and v2 now
qualify for the broader-still "no quotient axiom" tier.

## Audit command

```
cat > /tmp/axcheck.lean << END
import <module>
#print axioms <theorem>
END
cd lean && lake env lean /tmp/axcheck.lean
```

If output is "does not depend on any axioms", STRICT 0-AXIOM.

## Future cleanup

Many theorems at ≤ {propext, Quot.sound} could be upgraded by:
  1. Replacing omega with kernel-level lemmas
  2. Replacing simp[...] (uses propext) with rw
  3. Avoiding funext (uses Quot.sound) when not needed

Estimated upgrades: ~50-100 theorems possible.
