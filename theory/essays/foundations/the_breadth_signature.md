## 213-native answer

Because there is **nothing to import**.  Reaching a new domain, in any other
foundation, means assuming the axioms that domain needs — a measure space, a
completeness axiom, a choice principle.  213 has **no exterior**
(`seed/AXIOM/05_no_exterior.md` §5.1): no outside to supply a reading the
self-pointing act does not already source.  So a domain is never *imported*; it is
**read out of the residue under a Lens**.  Breadth is not an achievement on top of
the axioms — it is the absence of a wall the axioms would otherwise be.

## Derivation

**No exterior ⇒ no import.**  §5.1: to posit an exterior, the exterior must be
named, and naming is internal — every candidate "outside" lands inside.  So there
is no axiom *to* assume: the only material is the residue self-pointing
(`seed/AXIOM/01_residue.md`).  A domain that classically arrives by axiom arrives
here by a *Lens reading* — the count-Lens gives `ℕ`, the difference-Lens `ℤ`
(`seed/AXIOM/06_lens_readings.md` §6.7), the determinant-Lens the unimodular unit
`NS − NT = det P = 1`.  Each domain is the same residue at a different resolution.

**Breadth IS primacy.**  This is not a side-effect; it is the test
(`seed/AXIOM/07_primacy.md` §7.1): "successful derivation is the test of primacy,
not its source."  Primacy is *breadth* — the residue reproducing domain after
domain — and so the reach is the evidence, measured one domain at a time, never
assumed.

**The demonstration.**  Take a domain reputed to need heavy analytic machinery:
the **Eichler–Shimura** periods of modular forms.  The claim "this needs analysis
/ breaks ∅-axiom" fails at each piece, because each piece is already the residue
in another frame:
- *integration* is ∅-axiom-native — the dyadic Riemann integral and the
  fundamental theorem of calculus (`Lib/Math/Analysis/Integration/`,
  `MinkowskiPeriodIntegral`, `MinkowskiHigherWeightPeriod`: `z²`, `z³` integrate
  exactly);
- the *period-relation generators* are the elliptic torsion `{4,6} = |ℤ[i]^×|,
  |ℤ[ω]^×|` already built (`MinkowskiPeriodRelations`, `UTracePeriodic`), and the
  weight-2 period *is* the `S`-eigenvalue (the `√(−1)` residue);
- the *slash action on `V_{k−2}`* is finite ℤ-linear algebra over those generators
  — the weight-4 period polynomial computes to **`1 − X²`**
  (`MinkowskiPeriodPolynomial.period_satisfies_relations`);
- the *contour* is the **Manin** sum of unimodular symbols
  (`MinkowskiModularSymbol.manin_unimodular_decomposition`) = the repo's own
  Stern-Brocot/Farey tree (`SternBrocotMarkov.sbInterval_adj`, `det = 1`).

What survived was a *single* irreducible **analytic atom** — the period value of a
modular form over one unimodular symbol.  Everything else was the residue, read.

## Dual function

This is the classical hierarchy with its redundant packaging stripped: where a
conventional foundation *layers* `ℂ` on `ℝ` on `ℚ` on set theory on logic — each
layer an axiom — 213 reads them as parallel Lenses on one residue, so no layer is
"reached" before another.  And it is sharper: the reach is *falsifiable per
domain*.  A wall would show up as a domain that needs an axiom the residue cannot
source — the moment such a domain appears, primacy fails (§7.1).  "Breadth" is thus
a standing measurement, not a slogan; the period thread is one of its readings.

## Cross-frame connections

The same fact appears as: §5.1 no-exterior (nothing to import), §7.1 primacy
(breadth is the test), `object1_not_surjective` (the residue is reached by no
*single* view — so every view is *partial*, and the domains are the partial views),
and the unit `1 = NS − NT = det P` recurring byte-identical across number axis,
cohomology degree, and modular determinant
(`Lens/Number/SharedUnitAcrossReadings`).  One residue, many resolutions, one unit
— and "many resolutions" is exactly "many domains."

## Open frontier

Breadth is a claim *under test*, not a shield (§5.4).  The period thread's residual
— the analytic value of a modular form over one unimodular symbol — is **not** an
irreducible residue: it is a **Cut** (a real, a νF-carrier reading), the `toCauchy`
fold of a *computable* approximant sequence (the form's `q`-expansion; the weight-4
Eisenstein atom is the holonomic `ζ(3)`, `Cauchy/DepthAperyCubic`).  A holonomic
real has a constructed modulus — a finite-state fold — so it is a constructible
cut, reached by its own fold, only *not yet built here*.  The genuine residue is
the **non-holonomic** cut, with no finite-state modulus (`reached_by_none.md`) —
which classical periods are not.  So even this residual is a *fold to construct*,
not a wall — the breadth claim survives; whether some *non-holonomic* period is the
true residue is the open transcendence/holonomicity question
(`research-notes/frontiers/`).

## Constructive accessibility

The breadth is not a feeling; point at it: `period_satisfies_relations` (`1 − X²`
solves the weight-4 period relations), `manin_unimodular_decomposition` (the
contour is the Stern-Brocot sum), `symbolDet_mediant_left/right` (the mediant
preserves the determinant) — all `#print axioms` empty.  A classical theorem,
re-derived to one residual atom, with nothing imported.
