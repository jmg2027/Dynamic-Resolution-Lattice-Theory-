# The Verification Spine — axiom → 1/α_em in one sitting

> **Purpose.** The repository is thousands of Lean files.  No external
> reader audits them all.  This document is the *single legible path* a
> skeptic can verify in an afternoon: from the 3-clause Raw axiom,
> through the forced atomic signature `(NS, NT, d) = (3, 2, 5)`,
> to the headline number `1/α_em` — every step a **named theorem**
> whose `#print axioms` output is **empty** (∅-axiom / PURE).
>
> Breadth (`seed/AXIOM/07_primacy.md` §7.1) is the proof of primacy.
> This spine is the *on-ramp* to that breadth — read it first, then
> branch into `theory/INDEX.md`.

## 0. The honest contract — what this spine proves, and what it does not

Two claims are routinely bundled in this repo; **they are not the same
claim**, and the spine keeps them apart on purpose.

| Claim | Guaranteed by | Status here |
|---|---|---|
| **∅-axiom purity** — the math imports no hidden assumption (`#print axioms T` is empty) | Lean kernel, mechanically | ✅ every theorem below, verified |
| **0 researcher degrees of freedom** — no Lens/structural choice was steered by the known answer | *not* the kernel — only forcing proofs or pre-registration | ⚠️ holds **unconditionally** for §1–§4 (forcing chain); §5 (physics deployment) is where the residual question lives — see §6 |

Purity says "this proof has no external axiom." It does **not** say
"this derivation path was fixed before we saw 137.036." Those are
different guarantees. The forcing chain (§1–§4) closes the second gap
too — there is genuinely **no choice** there, and that is proven. The
deployment (§5) is honest about where the gap is not yet closed (§6).

This separation is itself the `seed/AXIOM/05_no_exterior.md` §5.4 guard
applied to ourselves: claim only what is verified, name the open edge
plainly.

---

## 1. The axiom — Raw (zero free parameters by construction)

The entire framework begins with one type and one operation.

- **Type** `Raw := { t : Tree // t.canonical = true }`
  — `lean/E213/Theory/Raw/Core.lean`
- **Two atoms** `Raw.a`, `Raw.b` (the first distinguishing).
- **Operation** `Raw.slash : (x y : Raw) → x ≠ y → Raw`
  — the *referring* / pairing mechanism (`Theory/Raw/Slash.lean`).
  Anti-reflexive (`x ≠ y`): pairing with self creates no distinction.
- **Direction-free** `Raw.slash_comm : slash x y h = slash y x h'`
  — the pairing imposes no order (`Theory/Raw/Slash.lean`).

There is nothing to tune. `Raw` is a free magma on 2 generators with a
symmetric, anti-reflexive combine. Every number below is forced *out of
this*, not dialed *into* it. (Public surface: `Theory/Raw/API.lean`.)

---

## 2. The signature — `(NS, NT, d) = (3, 2, 5)` forced (no atomic `c`)

`(NS, NT)` and `d = NS + NT` are theorems, not settings (all PURE, §7).
There is **no fourth atomic parameter `c`**: the gauge content is `NS² − 1`,
direct from the forced `NS = 3` (the SU(3) adjoint, `SpectrumComplete.alpha_3_channel`);
no graph multiplicity is needed.  The genuine "2" of the framework is the
binary distinguishing — the relation arity / the period-2 difference-sign /
the imaginary unit `i` — which lives in the metric **signature** `(−,+,+,+)`,
not in any edge count.

> **Rebuild in progress.**  The headline `1/α_em` spine in §3 still quotes the
> Lean as it currently stands, where the leading coefficients are written
> through an edge count carrying a `c`.  That is being re-derived c-free
> (`12 = NS·NT²`, …); until the Lean is rebuilt and re-verified to the same
> ppb, §3 reflects the pre-rebuild form.

### 2.1 Pair size and closure size → `NT = 2`, `NS = 3`

```
NonDecomposable.non_decomposable_iff (n : Nat) :
    NonDecomposable n ↔ n = 2 ∨ n = 3
```
`lean/E213/Theory/Atomicity/NonDecomposable.lean` — the only
non-decomposable sizes are **2** and **3**. The pair size is the
smaller (`NT = 2`), the closure size the larger (`NS = 3`).

```
PairForcing.pair_forcing (p q : Nat) (hp : 2 ≤ p) (hpq : p < q) :
    count p q = 1 ↔ (p = 2 ∧ q = 3)
```
`lean/E213/Theory/Atomicity/PairForcing.lean` — `(2, 3)` is the
**unique** pair in range with a single atomic candidate count. Not one
choice among many; the unique one.

### 2.2 Atomic count → `d = 5`

```
Five.atomic_iff_five (n : Nat) : Atomic n ↔ n = 5
PairForcing.atomic_23_iff_five (n : Nat) : Atomic 2 3 n ↔ n = 5
```
`lean/E213/Theory/Atomicity/Five.lean` — the atomic structure built
from `(2, 3)` has exactly `2·1 + 3·1 = 5` cells. `d = 5` is forced.

### 2.3 Combine arity = 2 (the binary slash)

```
CombinatorialArity.arity_2_unique_via_k_ge_3_vacuous :
    ∀ (k : Nat), 3 ≤ k → ∀ (xs : Fin k → Raw k), ¬ Reachable k (.rel xs)
```
`lean/E213/Theory/Atomicity/CombinatorialArity.lean` — for every arity
`k ≥ 3`, the combine constructor is **vacuous** (uniform pigeonhole
over a `Fin 2` base: `pigeonhole_fin_to_fin2`).  The relation arity is
binary.  (This is the arity of the distinguishing slash — a property of
the relation's *inputs* — not an edge multiplicity; there is no atomic
`c`.)

### 2.4 Dynamic confirmation — Pell–Lucas orbit

```
OrbitForcing.orbit_forcing_master :
    pellLucasEq 3 1 ∧ boundedUniqueBool = true ∧ (8 explicit failures)
```
`lean/E213/Theory/Atomicity/OrbitForcing.lean` — the static shape
forcing lifts to the recurrence: `(NS, det) = (3, 1)` is the unique
solution of the Pell–Lucas relation hitting `L(2) = 7`, with all 8
non-canonical pairs in `{1,2,3}²` refuted individually.

> **This is the crown jewel.** §2 has *zero researcher degrees of
> freedom*: no constant is chosen, each is the unique solution of a
> forcing equation, and Lean confirms purity. A skeptic auditing only
> §2 already has the strongest claim in the repository.

## 3. The deployment — `1/α_em` to 0.2 ppb

Everything in §2 feeds one capstone theorem
(`lean/E213/Lib/Physics/AlphaEM/GramStructuralCapstone.lean`):

```
GramStructuralCapstone.invAlphaEm_precision_theorem :
    -- (1) base-formula coefficients are functions of the forced atoms:
    k32_edges NS NT c * d = 60   ∧  NS * NT * d = 30  ∧  d * d = 25
    ∧ NS + 1 = 4                 ∧  NS * NS * d = 45
    -- (2) Gram correction, Newton-1 from X (no observed α on RHS):
    ∧ gram_correction_structural = 2130
    -- (3) prediction = X − α²/d²:
    ∧ alphaInv_structural_e9 = alphaInv_213_e9 - gram_correction_structural
    -- (4) numerical value:
    ∧ alphaInv_structural_e9 = 137035999111
    -- (5) residual to CODATA:
    ∧ alphaInv_structural_e9 = observed_e9 + 27        -- 27 × 10⁻⁹
    -- (7) only (NS, NT, c, d) appear:
    ∧ NS = 3 ∧ NT = 2 ∧ c = 2 ∧ d = 5
```

Reading the coefficients with the forced `(NS, NT, d) = (3, 2, 5)` at
presentation `c = 2` (a free presentation parameter):

| Coefficient | Structural form | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `60` | `edges(K_{3,2}^{(c=2)}) · d = 12 · 5` | 60 |
| `30` | `NS · NT · d = 3 · 2 · 5` | 30 |
| `25` | `d² = 5²` | 25 |
| `4`  | `NS + 1` | 4 |
| `45` | `NS² · d = 9 · 5` | 45 |
| Gram | Newton-1 root of `25y³ + 1 = 25Xy²` | 2130 |

**Result.** `1/α_em(structural) = 137,035,999,111 × 10⁻⁹`
vs CODATA `137,035,999,084 × 10⁻⁹` → residual **27 × 10⁻⁹ ≈ 0.2 ppb**.
PURE (verified §7) — the Gram correction uses *only* `alphaInv_213_e9`
on the RHS, no observed α (`gram_correction_structural_no_observed_alpha`).

---

## 4. Independent re-implementation

You do not have to trust Lean. An **independent ℕ-only Rust engine**
(`rust-engine/`, 53 binaries, 184 tests, 94 Lean-theorem citations
resolved at theorem-id level) recomputes the same arithmetic. Two
independent implementations agreeing is evidence the result is in the
math, not in one prover's quirks. Entry: `rust-engine/docs/architecture.md`.

---

## 5. Reproduce it yourself

```bash
cd lean
# forcing chain (fast, ~1 min):
lake build E213.Theory.Atomicity
python3 ../tools/scan_axioms.py \
  E213.Theory.Atomicity.PairForcing E213.Theory.Atomicity.Five \
  E213.Theory.Atomicity.NonDecomposable \
  E213.Theory.Atomicity.CombinatorialArity \
  E213.Theory.Atomicity.OrbitForcing
#   → every theorem above prints [PURE]

# the α_em capstone (slower, builds Lib/Physics):
lake build E213.Lib.Physics.AlphaEM.GramStructuralCapstone
python3 ../tools/scan_axioms.py \
  E213.Lib.Physics.AlphaEM.GramStructuralCapstone
#   → invAlphaEm_precision_theorem prints [PURE]
```

A non-empty `#print axioms` output on any of these = `sorry`-equivalent
(`CLAUDE.md` "∅-axiom standard"). The contract is that the output is
empty, and it is.

---

## 6. The one open edge — the degrees-of-freedom ledger

Honesty per §0. The forcing chain (§2) has zero researcher DoF, proven.
The deployment (§3) expresses every coefficient as a *function of the
forced atoms* — that is strong (the numbers are not free) — but two
residual choices are not yet themselves forced theorems:

1. **The assignment** of which atom-combination indexes which layer of
   the 5-layer base formula (the *map*, not the *values*).
2. **The Newton-1 Gram step** — structurally derived, but the choice of
   the self-consistency cubic `25y³ + 1 = 25Xy²` is a modeling input.

Closing these — a per-coefficient ledger tagging each as
`forced / derived / assignment / modeling-form / fitted`, then converting
the residual entries into forcing proofs or a pre-registered prediction —
is the highest-leverage next step for the **physics branch's**
falsifiability gate. It does not touch §2, and it does not touch the math
branch, whose primacy rests on breadth (`07_primacy.md` §7.1), not on
this number.

**That ledger now exists: `DEGREES_OF_FREEDOM_LEDGER.md`** — every choice
in the `1/α_em` derivation enumerated and tagged, with the residual DoF
narrowed to exactly three named items.
