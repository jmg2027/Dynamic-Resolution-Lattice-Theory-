# The Minimal System of Binary Relations

**Axiom.** *There exists a relation object between two objects.*

We take this as the sole axiom of what follows and derive the resulting
structure.

---

## 0. Notation and conventions

- `Fin n` denotes the standard `n`-element type `{0, 1, …, n-1}`.
- `inductive T` denotes an initial algebra presentation: `T` is the
  smallest type closed under the listed constructors. Equivalently,
  `T` is the free algebra over its signature.
- `Raw.x` and `x.y` are type-theoretic dot notation; no semantic content.
- "Function equality" throughout means definitional/propositional
  equality of terms, not any quotient.
- All claims below are formally checked in Lean 4 (`E213.*` modules,
  0 `sorry`); we cite the Lean name where relevant.

## 1. Primitive type

**Definition 1.1 (Raw).** `Raw` is the inductive type with two
constructors:

```
inductive Raw
  | object   : Fin 2 → Raw
  | relation : Raw → Raw → Raw
```

The base constructor `object` enumerates the two objects required by
the axiom; the second constructor `relation` realizes the axiom's
"relation object between two objects."

**Definition 1.2 (Reachable).** The inductive predicate
`Reachable : Raw → Prop` is

```
  base : (i : Fin 2) → Reachable (object i)
  step : Reachable x → Reachable y → x ≠ y →
         Reachable (relation x y).
```

The apartness `x ≠ y` is a technical encoding of the axiom's "two":
the step constructor fires only from *two* Reachable arguments, not
one repeated. No negation primitive is introduced at the axiomatic
level; `≠` is purely Lean's bookkeeping of "two distinct."

**Definition 1.3 (Well-formedness).**

```
Raw.wellFormed : Raw → Prop
  | object _     => True
  | relation x y => x ≠ y ∧ x.wellFormed ∧ y.wellFormed.
```

---

## 2. Characterization and decidability

**Theorem 2.1.** `Reachable x ↔ x.wellFormed`.

*Proof.* (Lean: `E213.Clean213.reachable_iff_wellFormed`.)

(⇒) By induction on the Reachable derivation. Base: `wellFormed
(object i) = True`, immediate. Step: from `Reachable x`, `Reachable
y`, `x ≠ y` with induction hypotheses `x.wellFormed, y.wellFormed`,
conclude `(relation x y).wellFormed = x ≠ y ∧ x.wellFormed ∧
y.wellFormed` using the three hypotheses.

(⇐) By induction on the structure of `x`. Base `object i`: apply
`Reachable.base i`. Relation `relation x y` with hypothesis
`x ≠ y ∧ x.wellFormed ∧ y.wellFormed`: destructure, apply induction
hypotheses on `x`, `y`, then `Reachable.step`. ∎

**Corollary 2.2 (Decidability).** `Reachable` is decidable on `Raw`.

*Proof.* `Raw` has decidable equality (derived from its finite
signature and `DecidableEq (Fin 2)`); `wellFormed` is decidable by
structural recursion; combine via Theorem 2.1. ∎

**Theorem 2.3 (No self-relation).** For every `x : Raw`,
`¬ Reachable (relation x x)`.

*Proof.* By Theorem 2.1 this reduces to `¬ (x ≠ x ∧ ...)`, which
is immediate from `x = x`. ∎

**Theorem 2.4 (Relation inversion).**
`Reachable (relation x y) → Reachable x ∧ Reachable y ∧ x ≠ y`.

*Proof.* Reduce to well-formedness; destructure. ∎

---

## 3. The swap automorphism

**Definition 3.1 (Swap).** Let `flip : Fin 2 → Fin 2` be the
non-identity permutation. Define `swap : Raw → Raw` by

```
  swap (object i)     := object (flip i)
  swap (relation x y) := relation (swap x) (swap y).
```

**Theorem 3.2 (Involution).** `swap (swap x) = x` for all `x : Raw`.

*Proof.* By induction on `x`, using `flip ∘ flip = id`. ∎

**Corollary 3.3 (Bijectivity).** `swap` is a bijection on `Raw`.

**Theorem 3.4 (Reachable-preservation).** `Reachable x → Reachable (swap x)`.

*Proof.* By induction on the Reachable derivation; the step case
uses Corollary 3.3 to propagate the apartness hypothesis. ∎

**Definition 3.5 (Raw-automorphism).** A *Raw-automorphism* is a
bijection `φ : Raw → Raw` satisfying, for some permutation
`σ : Fin 2 → Fin 2`,

```
  φ (object i)     = object (σ i),
  φ (relation x y) = relation (φ x) (φ y).
```

Such `φ` is uniquely determined by `σ`: by induction on `Raw`, the
value of `φ` on any term is fixed by `σ` and the recursive clause.

**Theorem 3.6 (Automorphism group).** The group `Aut(Raw)` of
Raw-automorphisms is isomorphic to the symmetric group `S_{Fin 2}`,
hence to `ℤ/2`. Its nontrivial element is `swap`.

*Proof.* The map `σ ↦ φ_σ` (with `φ_σ` built recursively from `σ`)
is a bijection `Perm(Fin 2) → Aut(Raw)`: injectivity follows from
`φ_σ (object i) = object (σ i)`, surjectivity from Definition 3.5.
One checks `φ_{σ∘σ'} = φ_σ ∘ φ_{σ'}`, so the bijection is a group
isomorphism. `Perm(Fin 2) = S_2 ≅ ℤ/2`; its non-identity is the flip,
inducing `swap`. ∎

---

## 4. Lens framework

**Definition 4.1 (Lens).** A `Lens` with codomain type `α` is a pair

```
  Lens α = (objValue : Fin 2 → α, combine : α → α → α).
```

**Definition 4.2 (Catamorphism).** The `view` of a Lens `L : Lens α` is

```
  L.view (object i)     := L.objValue i
  L.view (relation x y) := L.combine (L.view x) (L.view y).
```

**Definition 4.3 (Kernel equivalence).** For `L : Lens α`, define
`L.equiv x y := L.view x = L.view y`. This is reflexive, symmetric,
and transitive; it is the kernel equivalence of `L.view`.

**Definition 4.4 (Refinement).** `L` refines `M` (written `L.refines M`)
iff `∀ x y, L.equiv x y → M.equiv x y`, i.e. `M.view` factors
through `L.view`.

**Theorem 4.5 (Catamorphism universality).** For any `α`, `b : Fin 2 → α`,
`c : α → α → α`, there exists a unique `φ : Raw → α` with
`φ (object i) = b i` and `φ (relation x y) = c (φ x) (φ y)`. This `φ`
is `view` of the Lens `(b, c)`.

*Proof.* Existence by the inductive definition; uniqueness by
induction on `Raw`. ∎

---

## 5. Signature forcing (arity and base size)

We examine whether the signature `(Fin 2, binary relation)` is
forced by non-vacuity.

**Definition 5.1 (Generalized Raw).** For `N, k : ℕ`, define

```
inductive RawNk (N k : Nat)
  | object : Fin N → RawNk
  | rel    : (Fin k → RawNk) → RawNk,
```

with Reachable predicate

```
  base : (i : Fin N) → ReachableNk (object i)
  step : (f : Fin k → RawNk) →
         (∀ i, ReachableNk (f i)) →
         (∀ i j, i ≠ j → f i ≠ f j) →
         ReachableNk (rel f).
```

(Definition 1.1 is the case `N = k = 2`.)

**Lemma 5.2 (Pigeonhole).** For `N < k`, there is no injection
`Fin k → Fin N`.

*Proof.* (Lean: `E213.Pigeonhole.no_inj_lt`.) It suffices to show
no injection `g : Fin (N+1) → Fin N` exists; a larger `k > N` gives
one by restriction. Induct on `N`.

*Case* `N = 0`: `Fin 0` is empty, so `g ⟨0, _⟩ : Fin 0` is
uninhabited; contradiction.

*Case* `N = m+1`: given `g : Fin (m+2) → Fin (m+1)` assumed
injective, set `v := g ⟨m+1, _⟩`. Define the "shift-around"
`s : Fin (m+1) \ {v} → Fin m` by
```
  s(w) = ⟨w.val, _⟩      if w.val < v.val,
  s(w) = ⟨w.val - 1, _⟩  if w.val > v.val.
```
For each `i : Fin (m+1)`, injectivity of `g` yields
`g ⟨i.val, _⟩ ≠ v`, so `s (g ⟨i.val, _⟩)` is defined. The composite
`g' : Fin (m+1) → Fin m, g' i := s(g ⟨i.val, _⟩)` is injective
(both `g` restricted and `s` are), contradicting the induction
hypothesis. ∎

**Theorem 5.3 (Vacuousness).** In `RawNk N k` with `N < k`, every
`ReachableNk`-term is a base object.

*Proof.* Induction on the Reachable derivation. Base: immediate.
Step case: `f : Fin k → RawNk` with each `f i` Reachable and
pairwise distinct. By induction hypothesis, each `f i = object (g i)`
for some `g i : Fin N` (witness extracted via `Classical.choose`
applied to the existential). Injectivity of `g` follows from
pairwise distinctness of `f`. Lemma 5.2 contradicts. ∎

**Corollary 5.4.** Non-vacuity requires `N ≥ k`. The remaining
arities `k = 0, 1` are degenerate in the following precise senses:
- `k = 0`: `rel` takes no arguments, so `rel : RawN0`; every Reachable
  term is either a base object or `rel` itself — a finite system.
  The Reachable set fails to embed any non-trivial branching
  relation structure.
- `k = 1`: `rel : RawN1 → RawN1`; Reachable terms form a sequence
  `object i, rel(object i), rel(rel(object i)), …` linearly ordered
  by depth. The resulting binary "relation structure" is the
  singleton relation `rel` of arity `1`, carrying no information
  about distinct related objects.

Call an arity *degenerate* iff either of these conditions holds;
*non-degenerate* iff `k ≥ 2`. The minimal non-degenerate, non-vacuous
signature is therefore `(N, k) = (2, 2)`.

This is the signature of Definition 1.1.

## 6. Atomicity

In §1–5 the axiom produced `Raw`, the swap automorphism
`Aut(Raw) ≅ ℤ/2`, the Lens framework, and the forced signature
`(Fin 2, binary)`. We now derive the unique vertex count admitting a
canonical atomic partition.

The atomicity argument uses three components — a lower bound on atom
size, the atom set itself, and an "alive" predicate — each of which
is grounded in the primitive. The grounding is audited component-
wise in Remark 6.6 (after the main theorem is stated and proved).
Proposition 6.5 below provides the arithmetic characterization of
the atom set.

**Setup.** Given the atom set `A = {2, 3}` (justified arithmetically
by Proposition 6.5 and grounded in the primitive by Remark 6.6),
consider decompositions of `n ∈ ℕ` as `n = 2a + 3b` with
`(a, b) ∈ ℕ²`.

**Definition 6.1 (Alive).** A decomposition `(a, b)` is *alive* iff
`a` and `b` are both odd.

**Definition 6.2 (Atomic).** `n` is *atomic* iff there exists a unique
pair `(a, b) ∈ ℕ²` with `n = 2a + 3b`, and that pair is alive.

**Theorem 6.3 (Atomicity).** `n ∈ ℕ` is atomic iff `n = 5`.

*Proof.* (Lean: `E213.Atomicity.atomic_iff_five`.)

*`⇐` (Existence at `n = 5`).* From `3b ≤ 5` we get `b ∈ {0, 1}`;
`b = 0` gives `2a = 5`, impossible; `b = 1` gives `a = 1`. So the
unique decomposition is `(1, 1)`, alive. Hence `5` is atomic.

*`⇒` (Only `n = 5`).* Let `(a, b)` be the unique alive decomposition
of `n`. The *Bézout shift*
```
  (a, b) ↦ (a ± 3, b ∓ 2)
```
preserves `2a + 3b`. If `a ≥ 3`, then `(a - 3, b + 2) ∈ ℕ²` is a
valid second decomposition, contradicting uniqueness; hence `a < 3`.
If `b ≥ 2`, then `(a + 3, b - 2) ∈ ℕ²` is likewise a second valid
decomposition; hence `b < 2`. Combined with `a, b` odd and
nonnegative, this forces `a = b = 1`, giving `n = 2·1 + 3·1 = 5`. ∎

**Corollary 6.4.** The unique atomic `n` admits the unique atomic
decomposition `(1, 1)`: one 2-block and one 3-block, total `5`
vertices in `V = V_A ⊔ V_B` with `|V_A| = 3, |V_B| = 2`.

**Proposition 6.5 (Characterization of `{2, 3}`).** An integer
`n ≥ 2` *cannot* be expressed as a sum `n = n_1 + ⋯ + n_k` with
`k ≥ 2` and each `n_i ≥ 2` if and only if `n ∈ {2, 3}`.

*Proof.* (Lean: `E213.NonDecomposable.non_decomposable_iff`.)

Any `k`-part decomposition with `k ≥ 2` and parts `≥ 2` collapses
to a 2-part one: take `a := n_1` and `b := n_2 + ⋯ + n_k`; then
`a ≥ 2` and `b ≥ 2(k-1) ≥ 2`. It suffices to treat the 2-part case.

- `n = 2`: any `a + b = 2` with `a, b ≥ 2` gives `a + b ≥ 4 > 2`;
  impossible. Non-decomposable.
- `n = 3`: same, `a + b ≥ 4 > 3`; impossible. Non-decomposable.
- `n = 4`: `4 = 2 + 2`. Decomposable.
- `n ≥ 5`: `n = 2 + (n - 2)` with `n - 2 ≥ 3 ≥ 2`. Decomposable. ∎

We henceforth call `n` *non-decomposable* iff `n ∈ {2, 3}`.

**Remark 6.6 (Status of the atom hypothesis).** With Proposition 6.5
in hand, we can break the atom hypothesis into parts and locate
precisely where §1–5 does and does not suffice.

(a) *Lower bound `n ≥ 2`.* The primitive (Axiom; Definition 1.1)
concerns *relation between two objects*. A hypothetical atom of
size `1` — a solitary object — cannot instantiate the primitive
at all: the `relation` constructor requires two distinct
Reachable arguments (Definition 1.2, Theorem 2.3). We take this
as sufficient motivation within §1–5 for restricting atom sizes
to `≥ 2`.

(b) *Atom identification `A = {2, 3}`.* The principled derivation
is arithmetic. By Proposition 6.5, the non-decomposable integers
`≥ 2` — those that cannot be written as a sum of `k ≥ 2` parts
each `≥ 2` — are exactly `{2, 3}`. This is the standard meaning of
"atom" (irreducible under the composition in question) and it is
independent of §1–5. Combined with (a), the atom set is fixed as
`A = {2, 3}`.
(Lean: `E213.NonDecomposable.non_decomposable_iff`.)

An informal parallel: the same two sizes occur as natural
cardinalities in the primitive data — the input pair (`|{o_0, o_1}|
= 2`) and the first closure under a single relation application
(`|{o_0, o_1, relation o_0 o_1}| = 3`). This observation is
consistent with Proposition 6.5 but is not used to derive it; it is
recorded for intuition.
(Lean: `E213.PrimitiveSizes.primitive_sizes_eq_nondecomposable`.)

(c) *The alive predicate is Raw-intrinsic.* The condition "both
`a` and `b` odd" is *not* an external hypothesis: it is Raw's
distinctness rule applied at the multiplicity level.

The single structural rule of Raw is `x ≠ y` in every
`relation x y` (Definition 1.2). This rule applies at every level
of nesting: no Reachable term may have two structurally identical
direct sub-terms (Theorem 2.3 generalizes inductively — at every
node of a Reachable Raw tree, the two arguments are distinct).

Lifting this rule to multiplicities of structurally identical
atoms in a vertex partition: two structurally identical copies of
the same atom-type cannot coexist as distinct ingredients
(Raw distinguishes nothing within a structural-equivalence class).
Paired copies *annihilate* — they contribute nothing because the
pair has no Raw-distinguishable content. Only odd residues survive.

Concretely: a multiplicity `a` of a single atom-type contributes
to the structure as `a mod 2`, by repeated pair-cancellation.
The "alive" condition `a % 2 = 1 ∧ b % 2 = 1` is exactly the
statement that both atom-types have surviving (odd) residues. (Lean:
`E213.AliveFromDistinctness.alive_iff_odd_pair`.)

This is the same mechanism as exterior algebra: `v ∧ v = 0` is
not an axiom of `∧` but a formal expression of "two structurally
identical inputs cancel." Raw's `x ≠ y` is the same principle in
its primitive form, of which exterior algebra is a concrete model.

**Scope claim (revised).** All three components are grounded in the
primitive:

- (a) *Lower bound `≥ 2`*: the axiom's "two objects" rules out
  atoms of size `1`.
- (b) *Atom set `{2, 3}`*: by Proposition 6.5, the non-decomposable
  integers `≥ 2` are exactly `{2, 3}` — the standard "atom as
  irreducible" identification, independent of §1–5. (The same two
  sizes occur as natural cardinalities of the input pair and first
  closure; this is recorded as a parallel intuition.)
- (c) *Alive predicate*: Raw's rule `x ≠ y` applied at the
  multiplicity level, as above.

Theorem 6.3 (Atomicity → `n = 5`) follows from the axiom alone.
No external hypothesis is imported in §6.

## 7. Block structure and invariance

Take `V := Fin 5` with the canonical partition
`V_A := {0, 1, 2}, V_B := {3, 4}`.

**Definition 7.1.** The partition indicator is
`isA : Fin 5 → Bool, isA i := (i.val < 3)`.

**Definition 7.2 (Block-pair classifier).** Define
`classify : Fin 5 × Fin 5 → BlockPair` where `BlockPair` has six
values:

```
AAdiag   -- (i, i) with i ∈ V_A       (3 pairs)
AAoff    -- (i, j) with i ≠ j in V_A  (6 pairs)
AB       -- (i, j), i ∈ V_A, j ∈ V_B  (6 pairs)
BA       -- (i, j), i ∈ V_B, j ∈ V_A  (6 pairs)
BBdiag   -- (i, i) with i ∈ V_B       (2 pairs)
BBoff    -- (i, j) with i ≠ j in V_B  (2 pairs)
```

The six orbits exhaust `Fin 5 × Fin 5`, confirming
`3 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 25 = |V|²`.

**Definition 7.3 (Partition-preserving permutation).** A bijection
`σ : Fin 5 → Fin 5` *preserves the partition* iff
`isA (σ i) = isA i` for all `i`.

The group of partition-preserving bijections is isomorphic to
`S_{V_A} × S_{V_B} ≅ S_3 × S_2`, of order 12.

**Definition 7.4 (Block-constant weight).** A function
`W : Fin 5 × Fin 5 → α` is *block-constant* iff it factors through
`classify`: `W i j = f (classify i j)` for some `f : BlockPair → α`.

**Theorem 7.5 (Block-constancy ⟹ Invariance).** If `W` is
block-constant then `W` is invariant under every partition-
preserving bijection: for every such `σ` and all `i, j`,
`W (σ i) (σ j) = W i j`.

*Proof.* (Lean: `E213.Simplex.block_constant_implies_aut_invariant`.)
For bijective partition-preserving `σ`, both `isA (σ i) = isA i` and
`σ i = σ j ↔ i = j` hold. Hence `classify (σ i) (σ j) = classify i j`.
Since `W = f ∘ classify`, the conclusion follows. ∎

**Theorem 7.6 (Invariance ⟹ Block-constancy).** Conversely, if `W`
is invariant under every partition-preserving bijection, then `W` is
block-constant.

*Proof.* We show two pairs in the same block-pair class have equal
`W`-values. Given `σ ∈ S_3` on `V_A`, extend to a partition-
preserving bijection `σ̂` of `V` by acting as identity on `V_B`;
analogously for `τ ∈ S_2` on `V_B`. Then `σ̂`, `τ̂`, and their
compositions are partition-preserving bijections, so `W` is invariant
under them.

*Class `AAdiag`.* Given `(i, i), (i', i')` with `i, i' ∈ V_A`: pick
`σ ∈ S_3` with `σ(i) = i'` (transitivity of `S_3` on `V_A`). Then
`W i i = W (σ̂ i) (σ̂ i) = W i' i'`.

*Class `AAoff`.* Given `(i, j), (i', j')` both with `i ≠ j ∈ V_A`
and `i' ≠ j' ∈ V_A`: `S_3` acts transitively on the `6` ordered
distinct pairs in `V_A` (|ordered distinct pairs| = `3·2 = 6 = |S_3|`;
the action is free on distinct pairs, hence transitive). Pick `σ`
with `σ(i) = i', σ(j) = j'`; then `W i j = W i' j'` by invariance.

*Class `AB`.* Given `(i, j), (i', j')` with `i, i' ∈ V_A`,
`j, j' ∈ V_B`: by transitivity of `S_3` on `V_A`, pick `σ ∈ S_3` with
`σ(i) = i'`. By transitivity of `S_2` on `V_B`, pick `τ ∈ S_2` with
`τ(j) = j'`. Then the composite `σ̂ ∘ τ̂` sends `(i, j) ↦ (i', j')`,
so `W i j = W i' j'`.

*Class `BA`.* Symmetric to `AB`: swap the roles of `σ` and `τ`.
Given `(i, j), (i', j')` with `i, i' ∈ V_B`, `j, j' ∈ V_A`: pick
`τ ∈ S_2` with `τ(i) = i'` and `σ ∈ S_3` with `σ(j) = j'`; the
composite sends `(i, j) ↦ (i', j')`.

*Class `BBdiag`.* Given `(i, i), (i', i')` with `i, i' ∈ V_B`: pick
`τ ∈ S_2` with `τ(i) = i'` (transitivity of `S_2` on `V_B`). Then
`W i i = W i' i'`.

*Class `BBoff`.* `V_B = {3, 4}`; the only ordered distinct pairs are
`(3, 4)` and `(4, 3)`. The non-identity `τ ∈ S_2` swaps them, giving
`W 3 4 = W 4 3`.

In every class, `W` is constant. Hence `W` factors through
`classify`. ∎

## 8. Aut-faithful Lens existence

We ask: when does the structure of §1–7 admit a Lens whose
automorphism behavior matches that of `Raw` itself? We do not
presuppose any specific target algebra; the conditions below are
imposed independently, and the existence and uniqueness of a
satisfying codomain are derived as a theorem. The identification of
this codomain with a familiar algebra is recorded only after the
derivation.

**Conditions on the codomain `K`.** We seek `K` carrying enough
structure to support the Lens framework with a meaningful
automorphism action. The minimal natural setting is an `ℝ`-algebra
satisfying:

- **(C1) Finite-dimensional over `ℝ`.** Lens values are determined
  inductively from `Fin 2` base data and a binary `combine`; an
  infinite-dimensional codomain would carry strictly more
  information than `Raw` provides.
- **(C2) Commutative.** The axiom names "two objects" symmetrically
  (the pair, not the ordered tuple). `Raw`'s `relation` constructor
  is syntactically ordered, but the axiom is not. Commutativity of
  `combine` is the value-level reflection of the axiom's symmetric
  reading.
- **(C3) Unital.** A multiplicative identity is the standard
  algebraic baseline; without it, classical structure theorems are
  not available in their usual form.
- **(C4) Division algebra.** Every nonzero element invertible — a
  Lens value cannot vanish without the corresponding Raw term being
  absent.

Call this class `𝒞`.

**Definition 8.1 (Algebra automorphism).** For `K ∈ 𝒞`, let
`Aut_ℝ(K)` denote the group of `ℝ`-algebra automorphisms of `K`
(i.e., ring automorphisms fixing `ℝ ⊆ K` pointwise).

**Definition 8.2 (Aut-equivariance).** Let `L : Lens α` (Definition
4.1) with codomain type `α := K` (so `L.objValue : Fin 2 → K` and
`L.combine : K → K → K`). `L` is *Aut-equivariant* iff there is a
group homomorphism `ρ : Aut(Raw) → Aut_ℝ(K)` such that, for every
`τ ∈ Aut(Raw)` and every `x : Raw`,
```
  L.view (τ x) = ρ(τ) (L.view x).
```

**Definition 8.3 (Aut-faithfulness).** `L` is *Aut-faithful* iff the
induced `ρ` of Definition 8.2 is a group *isomorphism*
`Aut(Raw) ≅ Aut_ℝ(K)` (not merely an injection).

**Theorem 8.4 (Existence and uniqueness in `𝒞`).** Within `𝒞`:

1. (Classification.) Up to `ℝ`-algebra isomorphism, `𝒞` contains
   exactly two elements: a one-dimensional one (call it `K_1`) and
   a two-dimensional one (call it `K_2`).
2. (Aut groups.) `|Aut_ℝ(K_1)| = 1` and `|Aut_ℝ(K_2)| = 2`.
3. (Faithful codomain.) Combined with `Aut(Raw) ≅ ℤ/2`
   (Theorem 3.6), exactly `K_2` admits an Aut-faithful Lens.

*Proof.*

(1) Every `K ∈ 𝒞` is a finite field extension of `ℝ`: (C2)+(C3)+(C4)
make `K` a field, and (C1) makes it algebraic over `ℝ`. Irreducible
polynomials over `ℝ` have degree `1` or `2` (fundamental theorem of
algebra applied to `ℝ[x]`), so `[K : ℝ] ∈ {1, 2}`. There is exactly
one isomorphism class at each dimension: dim `1` gives `ℝ` itself;
dim `2` gives the unique `ℝ`-algebra obtained by adjoining a root
of any monic irreducible quadratic (e.g. `x² + 1`).

(2) For `K_1` (dim `1`): any `ℝ`-algebra endomorphism is determined
by its value on `1`, which must be `1`. So `Aut_ℝ(K_1) = {id}`.
For `K_2` (dim `2`): write `K_2 = ℝ[α]` with `α² = -1`. Any
`σ ∈ Aut_ℝ(K_2)` is determined by `σ(α)`. From
`σ(α)² = σ(α²) = -1` we get `σ(α) = ±α`. So `|Aut_ℝ(K_2)| = 2`.

(3) Aut-faithfulness (Definition 8.3) requires
`|Aut(Raw)| = |Aut_ℝ(K)|`. By Theorem 3.6, `|Aut(Raw)| = 2`. From
(2), this matches only `K_2`; for `K_2` the unique nontrivial
group isomorphism `ρ : ℤ/2 → ℤ/2` lifts `swap` to the nontrivial
element of `Aut_ℝ(K_2)`. ∎

**Corollary 8.5 (Identification).** The two-dimensional `K_2 ∈ 𝒞`
of Theorem 8.4 is, by direct construction, the field of complex
numbers. Adjoining a root `α` of `x² + 1` to `ℝ` gives `ℝ[α]` with
`α² = -1`, which is the standard presentation of `ℂ` with `α = i`.
The nontrivial element of `Aut_ℝ(K_2)` is then complex conjugation
`i ↦ -i`. The unique Aut-faithful codomain in `𝒞` is therefore the
field `ℂ`, with `swap` lifted to conjugation.

**Corollary 8.6 (Non-commutative case excludes ℍ).** Dropping (C2)
from `𝒞` admits the quaternions `ℍ`, a finite-dim unital division
`ℝ`-algebra. However, `Aut_ℝ(ℍ) ≅ SO(3)` is a connected Lie group
of dimension `3`, and `|Aut(Raw)| = 2 ≠ |SO(3)|`. No group
isomorphism `Aut(Raw) ≅ Aut_ℝ(ℍ)` exists; hence `ℍ` admits no
Aut-faithful Lens. The commutativity condition (C2) is therefore
the decisive constraint separating the unique faithful codomain
`K_2` from `ℍ`.

**Remark 8.7 (On the remaining conditions in `𝒞`).** Corollary 8.6
has addressed (C2). The remaining conditions:
- *(C1) Finite-dim*: excludes infinite-dimensional `ℝ`-algebras
  (e.g., function algebras, formal power series). Needed to invoke
  the classification step (1) in Theorem 8.4.
- *(C3) Unital + (C4) Division*: exclude split algebras like
  `ℝ ⊕ ℝ` (which has zero divisors) and para-algebras without unit.

Each (C1)–(C4) is necessary for the existence-and-uniqueness
conclusion of Theorem 8.4.

**Remark 8.8 (Relation to Hurwitz–Frobenius).** The theorems of
Frobenius (finite-dim associative `ℝ`-division algebras are
`ℝ, ℂ, ℍ`) and Hurwitz (`ℝ`-composition algebras are
`ℝ, ℂ, ℍ, 𝕆`) play no external role here. Step (1) of the proof
uses only the commutative fragment of Frobenius (which reduces to
the elementary classification of finite `ℝ`-field extensions via
the fundamental theorem of algebra).

## Conclusion

The minimal system defined by the axiom

> *there exists a relation object between two objects*

consists of the following structure, presented here with precise
dependency tracking between claims.

**From the axiom alone (§1–5):**

1. A free inductive type `Raw` with constructors
   `object : Fin 2 → Raw` and `relation : Raw → Raw → Raw`,
   together with a Reachable predicate carving out well-formed
   terms and excluding self-relations (Theorem 2.3).

2. A single nontrivial Raw-automorphism (the swap involution),
   yielding `Aut(Raw) ≅ ℤ/2` (Theorem 3.6).

3. A Lens/catamorphism framework: every pair
   `(b : Fin 2 → α, c : α → α → α)` determines a unique
   `view : Raw → α` (Theorem 4.5), with kernel-equivalence and
   refinement as natural operations.

4. The signature `(Fin 2, binary)` is the unique minimal
   non-degenerate, non-vacuous signature: `N < k` makes the system
   vacuous (Theorem 5.3), and `k ∈ {0, 1}` yields structurally
   degenerate constants or unary chains (Corollary 5.4).

**From the axiom together with §6–7 (all three components of the
atom hypothesis now Raw-intrinsic; see Remark 6.6):**

5. The atom set `A = {2, 3}` is fixed by Proposition 6.5
   (non-decomposable integers `≥ 2`) combined with the primitive
   lower bound `≥ 2`. The alive predicate is Raw's distinctness
   rule at the multiplicity level (pair cancellation under
   structural equivalence). Together, `n = 5` is the unique atomic
   vertex count (Theorem 6.3), giving the canonical partition
   `V = V_A ⊔ V_B` with `|V_A| = 3, |V_B| = 2`.

6. The `S_3 × S_2` action yields exactly six orbits on `V × V`,
   with `3 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 25 = |V|²`, and invariance under
   this action is equivalent to block-constancy (Theorems 7.5–7.6).

**Within the class `𝒞` of codomains satisfying (C1)–(C4) of §8:**

7. There exists a unique element `K_2 ∈ 𝒞` (up to ℝ-algebra
   isomorphism) admitting an Aut-faithful Lens — one whose induced
   action matches `Aut(Raw) ≅ ℤ/2` exactly. By direct construction,
   this `K_2` is the field of complex numbers `ℂ` (Theorem 8.4 +
   Corollary 8.5). The non-commutative case (relaxing (C2)) admits
   `ℍ` but yields no Aut-faithful Lens (Corollary 8.6).

This is the minimal system defined by "there is a relation."

End.
