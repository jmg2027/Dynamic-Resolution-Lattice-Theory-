# The Minimal System of Binary Relations

**Axiom.** *There exists a relation object between two objects.*

We take this as the sole axiom of what follows and derive the resulting
structure.

---

## 0. Notation and conventions

- `Fin n` denotes the standard `n`-element type `{0, 1, …, n-1}`.
- `inductive T` denotes an initial algebra presentation: `T` is the
  smallest type closed under the listed constructors. Equivalently,
  `T` is the free algebra over its signature.
- `Raw.x` and `x.y` are type-theoretic dot notation; no semantic content.
- "Function equality" throughout means definitional/propositional
  equality of terms, not any quotient.
- All claims below are formally checked in Lean 4 (`E213.*` modules,
  0 `sorry`); we cite the Lean name where relevant.

## 1. Primitive type

**Definition 1.1 (Raw).** `Raw` is the inductive type with two
constructors:

```
inductive Raw
  | object   : Fin 2 → Raw
  | relation : Raw → Raw → Raw
```

The base constructor `object` enumerates the two objects required by
the axiom; the second constructor `relation` realizes the axiom's
"relation object between two objects."

**Definition 1.2 (Reachable).** The inductive predicate
`Reachable : Raw → Prop` is

```
  base : (i : Fin 2) → Reachable (object i)
  step : Reachable x → Reachable y → x ≠ y →
         Reachable (relation x y).
```

The apartness `x ≠ y` is a technical encoding of the axiom's "two":
the step constructor fires only from *two* Reachable arguments, not
one repeated. No negation primitive is introduced at the axiomatic
level; `≠` is purely Lean's bookkeeping of "two distinct."

**Definition 1.3 (Well-formedness).**

```
Raw.wellFormed : Raw → Prop
  | object _     => True
  | relation x y => x ≠ y ∧ x.wellFormed ∧ y.wellFormed.
```

---

## 2. Characterization and decidability

**Theorem 2.1.** `Reachable x ↔ x.wellFormed`.

*Proof.* (Lean: `E213.Clean213.reachable_iff_wellFormed`.)

(⇒) By induction on the Reachable derivation. Base: `wellFormed
(object i) = True`, immediate. Step: from `Reachable x`, `Reachable
y`, `x ≠ y` with induction hypotheses `x.wellFormed, y.wellFormed`,
conclude `(relation x y).wellFormed = x ≠ y ∧ x.wellFormed ∧
y.wellFormed` using the three hypotheses.

(⇐) By induction on the structure of `x`. Base `object i`: apply
`Reachable.base i`. Relation `relation x y` with hypothesis
`x ≠ y ∧ x.wellFormed ∧ y.wellFormed`: destructure, apply induction
hypotheses on `x`, `y`, then `Reachable.step`. ∎

**Corollary 2.2 (Decidability).** `Reachable` is decidable on `Raw`.

*Proof.* `Raw` has decidable equality (derived from its finite
signature and `DecidableEq (Fin 2)`); `wellFormed` is decidable by
structural recursion; combine via Theorem 2.1. ∎

**Theorem 2.3 (No self-relation).** For every `x : Raw`,
`¬ Reachable (relation x x)`.

*Proof.* By Theorem 2.1 this reduces to `¬ (x ≠ x ∧ ...)`, which
is immediate from `x = x`. ∎

**Theorem 2.4 (Relation inversion).**
`Reachable (relation x y) → Reachable x ∧ Reachable y ∧ x ≠ y`.

*Proof.* Reduce to well-formedness; destructure. ∎

---

## 3. The swap automorphism

**Definition 3.1 (Swap).** Let `flip : Fin 2 → Fin 2` be the
non-identity permutation. Define `swap : Raw → Raw` by

```
  swap (object i)     := object (flip i)
  swap (relation x y) := relation (swap x) (swap y).
```

**Theorem 3.2 (Involution).** `swap (swap x) = x` for all `x : Raw`.

*Proof.* By induction on `x`, using `flip ∘ flip = id`. ∎

**Corollary 3.3 (Bijectivity).** `swap` is a bijection on `Raw`.

**Theorem 3.4 (Reachable-preservation).** `Reachable x → Reachable (swap x)`.

*Proof.* By induction on the Reachable derivation; the step case
uses Corollary 3.3 to propagate the apartness hypothesis. ∎

**Definition 3.5 (Raw-automorphism).** A *Raw-automorphism* is a
bijection `φ : Raw → Raw` satisfying, for some permutation
`σ : Fin 2 → Fin 2`,

```
  φ (object i)     = object (σ i),
  φ (relation x y) = relation (φ x) (φ y).
```

Such `φ` is uniquely determined by `σ`: by induction on `Raw`, the
value of `φ` on any term is fixed by `σ` and the recursive clause.

**Theorem 3.6 (Automorphism group).** The group `Aut(Raw)` of
Raw-automorphisms is isomorphic to the symmetric group `S_{Fin 2}`,
hence to `ℤ/2`. Its nontrivial element is `swap`.

*Proof.* The map `σ ↦ φ_σ` (with `φ_σ` built recursively from `σ`)
is a bijection `Perm(Fin 2) → Aut(Raw)`: injectivity follows from
`φ_σ (object i) = object (σ i)`, surjectivity from Definition 3.5.
One checks `φ_{σ∘σ'} = φ_σ ∘ φ_{σ'}`, so the bijection is a group
isomorphism. `Perm(Fin 2) = S_2 ≅ ℤ/2`; its non-identity is the flip,
inducing `swap`. ∎

---

## 4. Lens framework

**Definition 4.1 (Lens).** A `Lens` with codomain type `α` is a pair

```
  Lens α = (objValue : Fin 2 → α, combine : α → α → α).
```

**Definition 4.2 (Catamorphism).** The `view` of a Lens `L : Lens α` is

```
  L.view (object i)     := L.objValue i
  L.view (relation x y) := L.combine (L.view x) (L.view y).
```

**Definition 4.3 (Kernel equivalence).** For `L : Lens α`, define
`L.equiv x y := L.view x = L.view y`. This is reflexive, symmetric,
and transitive; it is the kernel equivalence of `L.view`.

**Definition 4.4 (Refinement).** `L` refines `M` (written `L.refines M`)
iff `∀ x y, L.equiv x y → M.equiv x y`, i.e. `M.view` factors
through `L.view`.

**Theorem 4.5 (Catamorphism universality).** For any `α`, `b : Fin 2 → α`,
`c : α → α → α`, there exists a unique `φ : Raw → α` with
`φ (object i) = b i` and `φ (relation x y) = c (φ x) (φ y)`. This `φ`
is `view` of the Lens `(b, c)`.

*Proof.* Existence by the inductive definition; uniqueness by
induction on `Raw`. ∎

---

## 5. Signature forcing (arity and base size)

We examine whether the signature `(Fin 2, binary relation)` is
forced by non-vacuity.

**Definition 5.1 (Generalized Raw).** For `N, k : ℕ`, define

```
inductive RawNk (N k : Nat)
  | object : Fin N → RawNk
  | rel    : (Fin k → RawNk) → RawNk,
```

with Reachable predicate

```
  base : (i : Fin N) → ReachableNk (object i)
  step : (f : Fin k → RawNk) →
         (∀ i, ReachableNk (f i)) →
         (∀ i j, i ≠ j → f i ≠ f j) →
         ReachableNk (rel f).
```

(Definition 1.1 is the case `N = k = 2`.)

**Lemma 5.2 (Pigeonhole).** For `N < k`, there is no injection
`Fin k → Fin N`.

*Proof.* (Lean: `E213.Pigeonhole.no_inj_lt`.) It suffices to show
no injection `g : Fin (N+1) → Fin N` exists; a larger `k > N` gives
one by restriction. Induct on `N`.

*Case* `N = 0`: `Fin 0` is empty, so `g ⟨0, _⟩ : Fin 0` is
uninhabited; contradiction.

*Case* `N = m+1`: given `g : Fin (m+2) → Fin (m+1)` assumed
injective, set `v := g ⟨m+1, _⟩`. Define the "shift-around"
`s : Fin (m+1) \ {v} → Fin m` by
```
  s(w) = ⟨w.val, _⟩      if w.val < v.val,
  s(w) = ⟨w.val - 1, _⟩  if w.val > v.val.
```
For each `i : Fin (m+1)`, injectivity of `g` yields
`g ⟨i.val, _⟩ ≠ v`, so `s (g ⟨i.val, _⟩)` is defined. The composite
`g' : Fin (m+1) → Fin m, g' i := s(g ⟨i.val, _⟩)` is injective
(both `g` restricted and `s` are), contradicting the induction
hypothesis. ∎

**Theorem 5.3 (Vacuousness).** In `RawNk N k` with `N < k`, every
`ReachableNk`-term is a base object.

*Proof.* Induction on the Reachable derivation. Base: immediate.
Step case: `f : Fin k → RawNk` with each `f i` Reachable and
pairwise distinct. By induction hypothesis, each `f i = object (g i)`
for some `g i : Fin N` (witness extracted via `Classical.choose`
applied to the existential). Injectivity of `g` follows from
pairwise distinctness of `f`. Lemma 5.2 contradicts. ∎

**Corollary 5.4.** Non-vacuity requires `N ≥ k`. Arities `k = 0, 1`
are structurally degenerate: `k = 0` yields constants; `k = 1` gives
only a unary chain (`object i, rel(object i), rel(rel(object i)), …`),
which has no branching structure. The minimal non-degenerate,
non-vacuous choice is `(N, k) = (2, 2)`.

This is the signature of Definition 1.1.

## 6. An arithmetic atomicity result

We now establish a standalone arithmetic theorem, whose relevance to
§1–5 is motivational (discussed in Remark 6.5).

**Setup.** Fix the atom set `A = {2, 3}` and consider decompositions
of `n ∈ ℕ` as `n = 2a + 3b` with `(a, b) ∈ ℕ²`.

**Definition 6.1 (Alive).** A decomposition `(a, b)` is *alive* iff
`a` and `b` are both odd.

**Definition 6.2 (Atomic).** `n` is *atomic* iff there exists a unique
pair `(a, b) ∈ ℕ²` with `n = 2a + 3b`, and that pair is alive.

**Theorem 6.3 (Atomicity).** `n ∈ ℕ` is atomic iff `n = 5`.

*Proof.* (Lean: `E213.Atomicity.atomic_iff_five`.)

*`⇐` (Existence at `n = 5`).* From `3b ≤ 5` we get `b ∈ {0, 1}`;
`b = 0` gives `2a = 5`, impossible; `b = 1` gives `a = 1`. So the
unique decomposition is `(1, 1)`, alive. Hence `5` is atomic.

*`⇒` (Only `n = 5`).* Let `(a, b)` be the unique alive decomposition
of `n`. The *Bézout shift*
```
  (a, b) ↦ (a ± 3, b ∓ 2)
```
preserves `2a + 3b`. If `a ≥ 3`, then `(a - 3, b + 2) ∈ ℕ²` is a
valid second decomposition, contradicting uniqueness; hence `a < 3`.
If `b ≥ 2`, then `(a + 3, b - 2) ∈ ℕ²` is likewise a second valid
decomposition; hence `b < 2`. Combined with `a, b` odd and
nonnegative, this forces `a = b = 1`, giving `n = 2·1 + 3·1 = 5`. ∎

**Corollary 6.4.** The unique atomic `n` admits the unique atomic
decomposition `(1, 1)`: one 2-block and one 3-block, total `5`
vertices in `V = V_A ⊔ V_B` with `|V_A| = 3, |V_B| = 2`.

**Remark 6.5 (Status of the atom hypothesis).** The atom set
`A = {2, 3}` and the "alive" predicate (both `a, b` odd) are
*premises* of this section, not consequences of §1–5. We are
explicit about this:

(a) *Suggestive appearances of 2 and 3 in the primitive.* The
numerals appear as cardinalities: `|Fin 2| = 2` is the base; and
`|{object 0, object 1, relation (object 0) (object 1)}| = 3` is
the size of the smallest Reachable-closed set. These are
observations, not derivations. They do not show that `{2, 3}` is
the *unique* atom set compatible with §1–5, nor do they justify
excluding other candidates (e.g. `{2}`, `{3}`, `{2, 3, 5}`).

(b) *The alive predicate.* The condition "both `a` and `b` odd"
models antisymmetric cancellation of repeated atoms under a swap
action. No such swap action is constructed on vertex multiplicities
within §1–5; the condition is imported.

(c) *Scope claim.* Theorem 6.3 is therefore a *conditional* result:
*given* the atom set `{2, 3}` and the alive predicate, the unique
atomic `n` is `5`. Whether the atom hypothesis itself is forced by
some refinement of §1–5 is an open question.

We flag §6 (and, by inheritance, §7) as *not* derived from the
axiom alone. A derivation of the atom hypothesis is left to
subsequent work.

## 7. Block structure and invariance

Take `V := Fin 5` with the canonical partition
`V_A := {0, 1, 2}, V_B := {3, 4}`.

**Definition 7.1.** The partition indicator is
`isA : Fin 5 → Bool, isA i := (i.val < 3)`.

**Definition 7.2 (Block-pair classifier).** Define
`classify : Fin 5 × Fin 5 → BlockPair` where `BlockPair` has six
values:

```
AAdiag   -- (i, i) with i ∈ V_A       (3 pairs)
AAoff    -- (i, j) with i ≠ j in V_A  (6 pairs)
AB       -- (i, j), i ∈ V_A, j ∈ V_B  (6 pairs)
BA       -- (i, j), i ∈ V_B, j ∈ V_A  (6 pairs)
BBdiag   -- (i, i) with i ∈ V_B       (2 pairs)
BBoff    -- (i, j) with i ≠ j in V_B  (2 pairs)
```

The six orbits exhaust `Fin 5 × Fin 5`, confirming
`3 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 25 = |V|²`.

**Definition 7.3 (Partition-preserving permutation).** A bijection
`σ : Fin 5 → Fin 5` *preserves the partition* iff
`isA (σ i) = isA i` for all `i`.

The group of partition-preserving bijections is isomorphic to
`S_{V_A} × S_{V_B} ≅ S_3 × S_2`, of order 12.

**Definition 7.4 (Block-constant weight).** A function
`W : Fin 5 × Fin 5 → α` is *block-constant* iff it factors through
`classify`: `W i j = f (classify i j)` for some `f : BlockPair → α`.

**Theorem 7.5 (Block-constancy ⟹ Invariance).** If `W` is
block-constant then `W` is invariant under every partition-
preserving bijection: for every such `σ` and all `i, j`,
`W (σ i) (σ j) = W i j`.

*Proof.* (Lean: `E213.Simplex.block_constant_implies_aut_invariant`.)
For bijective partition-preserving `σ`, both `isA (σ i) = isA i` and
`σ i = σ j ↔ i = j` hold. Hence `classify (σ i) (σ j) = classify i j`.
Since `W = f ∘ classify`, the conclusion follows. ∎

**Theorem 7.6 (Invariance ⟹ Block-constancy).** Conversely, if `W`
is invariant under every partition-preserving bijection, then `W` is
block-constant.

*Proof.* We show two pairs in the same block-pair class have equal
`W`-values. `S_3` acts transitively on `V_A` and on ordered pairs of
distinct elements of `V_A`; `S_2` does likewise on `V_B`. Extend to
partition-preserving bijections of `V` by acting as identity on the
opposite block.

— For class `AAdiag`: given `(i, i), (i', i')` with `i, i' ∈ V_A`,
there is `σ ∈ S_3` with `σ i = i'`; invariance gives
`W i i = W (σ i) (σ i) = W i' i'`.

— For class `AAoff`: `S_3` acts transitively on ordered pairs
`(i, j)` with `i ≠ j ∈ V_A` (there are `3 · 2 = 6` such pairs, and
`|S_3| = 6`).

— For class `AB`: `S_3 × S_2` acts transitively on `V_A × V_B`
(|product| = 6, `|S_3 × S_2| = 12`, each orbit has size dividing 12;
transitive action verified directly).

— Classes `BA`, `BBdiag`, `BBoff`: symmetric arguments.

Thus `W` factors through `classify`, i.e. is block-constant. ∎

---

## 8. Codomain forcing for faithful Lenses

We now study, within a specified class of codomains, which admit a
canonical Lens compatible with `Aut(Raw)`.

**Class `𝒞`.** Fix the class of codomains
```
  𝒞 = {K : K is a finite-dimensional ℝ-algebra,
            commutative, with multiplicative identity, and
            a division algebra (every nonzero element is invertible)}.
```
We comment on these assumptions in Remark 8.5.

**Definition 8.1 (Algebra automorphism).** For `K ∈ 𝒞`, let
`Aut_ℝ(K)` denote the group of `ℝ`-algebra automorphisms of `K`
(i.e., ring automorphisms fixing `ℝ ⊆ K` pointwise).

**Definition 8.2 (Aut-equivariance).** A Lens `L : Lens K` is
*Aut-equivariant* iff there is a group homomorphism
`ρ : Aut(Raw) → Aut_ℝ(K)` such that, for every `τ ∈ Aut(Raw)` and
every `x : Raw`,
```
  L.view (τ x) = ρ(τ) (L.view x).
```

**Definition 8.3 (Aut-faithfulness).** `L` is *Aut-faithful* iff the
induced `ρ` of Definition 8.2 is a group *isomorphism*
`Aut(Raw) ≅ Aut_ℝ(K)` (not merely an injection).

**Theorem 8.4 (Faithful codomain in `𝒞`).** Let `K ∈ 𝒞`. If `K` admits
a nontrivial Aut-faithful Lens, then `K ≅ ℂ` as `ℝ`-algebras.

*Proof.*

(i) *Classification of `𝒞`.* Every `K ∈ 𝒞` is a finite field extension
of `ℝ`: commutativity + unital + division ⟹ `K` is a field, and
finite-dim over `ℝ` ⟹ `K` is algebraic over `ℝ`. The irreducible
polynomials over `ℝ` have degree `1` or `2` (by the fundamental
theorem of algebra applied to `ℝ[x]`), so `[K : ℝ] ∈ \{1, 2\}`.
Hence `K ≅ ℝ` or `K ≅ ℂ`. (This is the commutative case of
Frobenius's theorem.)

(ii) *Computation of `Aut_ℝ(K)`.*
- `Aut_ℝ(ℝ) = {id}` (trivial).
- `Aut_ℝ(ℂ) = {id, conjugation} ≅ ℤ/2` (by the theorem of the
  primitive element or direct computation).

(iii) *Faithfulness.* `Aut(Raw) ≅ ℤ/2` (Theorem 3.6). Aut-faithfulness
requires `Aut(Raw) ≅ Aut_ℝ(K)`.
- `K = ℝ`: `Aut_ℝ(ℝ) ≅ 1 ≠ ℤ/2`, so no `ρ` can be an isomorphism.
  Not faithful.
- `K = ℂ`: `Aut_ℝ(ℂ) ≅ ℤ/2`. The unique nontrivial homomorphism
  `ρ : ℤ/2 → ℤ/2` is the identity isomorphism; it lifts `swap` to
  conjugation on `ℂ`. Faithful.

Therefore `K ≅ ℂ`. ∎

**Remark 8.5 (On the class `𝒞`).** The four conditions defining `𝒞`
each exclude alternative codomains:
- *Finite-dim*: excludes infinite-dimensional ℝ-algebras (e.g.,
  function algebras, formal power series). Needed to invoke the
  classification step (i).
- *Commutative*: excludes `ℍ` (quaternions), for which
  `Aut_ℝ(ℍ) ≅ SO(3) ⊋ ℤ/2`, yielding a strict embedding not an
  isomorphism.
- *Unital + division*: excludes split algebras like `ℝ ⊕ ℝ`
  (which has zero divisors) and para-algebras without unit.

Each condition is necessary for the conclusion. A mathematician may
view Theorem 8.4 as: within the classical category of ℝ-fields,
`ℂ` is the unique object with automorphism group matching
`Aut(Raw) ≅ ℤ/2`.

**Remark 8.6 (Relation to Hurwitz–Frobenius).** The theorems of
Frobenius (finite-dim associative ℝ-division algebras are `ℝ, ℂ, ℍ`)
and Hurwitz (ℝ-composition algebras are `ℝ, ℂ, ℍ, 𝕆`) play no
external role here. Step (i) of the proof uses only the commutative
fragment of Frobenius (which reduces to Gelfand–Mazur). The wider
classification is of independent interest but not used.

## Conclusion

The minimal system defined by the axiom

> *there exists a relation object between two objects*

consists of the following structure, presented here with precise
dependency tracking between claims.

**From the axiom alone (§1–5):**

1. A free inductive type `Raw` with constructors
   `object : Fin 2 → Raw` and `relation : Raw → Raw → Raw`,
   together with a Reachable predicate carving out well-formed
   terms and excluding self-relations (Theorem 2.3).

2. A single nontrivial Raw-automorphism (the swap involution),
   yielding `Aut(Raw) ≅ ℤ/2` (Theorem 3.6).

3. A Lens/catamorphism framework: every pair
   `(b : Fin 2 → α, c : α → α → α)` determines a unique
   `view : Raw → α` (Theorem 4.5), with kernel-equivalence and
   refinement as natural operations.

4. The signature `(Fin 2, binary)` is the unique minimal
   non-degenerate, non-vacuous signature: `N < k` makes the system
   vacuous (Theorem 5.3), and `k ∈ {0, 1}` yields structurally
   degenerate constants or unary chains (Corollary 5.4).

**Conditional on the atom hypothesis `A = {2, 3}` with alive
predicate (§6–7 — a premise of these sections, not a consequence
of §1–5; see Remark 6.5):**

5. `n = 5` is the unique atomic vertex count (Theorem 6.3), giving
   the canonical partition `V = V_A ⊔ V_B` with
   `|V_A| = 3, |V_B| = 2`.

6. The `S_3 × S_2` action yields exactly six orbits on `V × V`,
   with `3 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 25 = |V|²`, and invariance under
   this action is equivalent to block-constancy (Theorems 7.5–7.6).

**Within the class of finite-dim commutative unital ℝ-division
algebras (§8):**

7. The unique such algebra admitting an Aut-faithful Lens — one
   whose induced action on the codomain matches `Aut(Raw) ≅ ℤ/2`
   exactly — is `ℂ` (Theorem 8.4).

This is the minimal system defined by "there is a relation."

End.
